# Bolt Foundry

We're building a structured approach to prompt engineering — transforming brittle text strings into composable cards with examples and specifications that make AI applications reliable and maintainable.

## What are Prompt Cards?

Like trading cards, our system uses structured cards to build AI behavior:
- **Persona Cards**: Define who the AI should be
- **Behavior Cards**: Define what the AI should do
- **Composable**: Mix and match cards to create new capabilities
- **Shareable**: Trade proven card patterns across teams
