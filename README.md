# Bolt Foundry

We're building a structured approach to prompt engineering — transforming
brittle text strings into composable cards with examples and specifications that
make AI applications reliable and maintainable.

## What are Prompt Cards?

Prompt cards are structured specifications that define AI behavior. Instead of writing prompts as long text strings, you build them from reusable components:

- **Persona Cards**: Define who the AI should be (traits, voice, constraints)
- **Behavior Cards**: Define what the AI should do (goals, steps, formats)
- **Examples**: Show good and bad behaviors with ratings
- **Specifications**: Organize requirements in clear, testable units

Like trading cards, these components are:
- **Composable**: Mix and match cards to create new capabilities
- **Shareable**: Share proven card patterns across teams
- **Collectible**: Build libraries of cards for different domains
