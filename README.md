# Bolt Foundry - Customer Success Platform for AI

**Make AI systems continuously improve through customer feedback, creating
reliable, customer-centric AI that gets better every day.**

Most AI systems are built and deployed without meaningful connection to customer
feedback. Companies launch AI features, get complaints, and struggle to
translate customer dissatisfaction into systematic improvements. Bolt Foundry
changes that with our RLHF workflow platform.

## The Problem

AI systems today are disconnected from customer success:

- **Disconnected systems**: AI behavior doesn't reflect actual customer needs
- **Unmeasurable impact**: No clear connection between AI changes and customer
  satisfaction
- **Untestable improvements**: Can't verify if changes actually help customers
- **Scaling challenges**: Each customer complaint requires manual investigation
  and custom fixes

## The Solution

Bolt Foundry provides a **Customer Success Platform for AI** that turns customer
feedback into systematic AI improvements through our RLHF workflow:

- **Feedback collection**: Systematic capture of customer interactions and
  satisfaction signals
- **Evaluation specs**: Automated generation of evaluation criteria from
  customer feedback patterns
- **Response optimization**: Continuous improvement of AI responses based on
  customer success metrics
- **Success tracking**: Measurable outcomes connecting customer satisfaction to
  AI improvements

## Why This Matters

### For Customer Success Teams

- Transform customer feedback into systematic AI improvements
- Measure and track customer satisfaction with AI interactions
- Identify patterns in customer needs and optimize AI responses
- Build customer-centric AI that continuously improves

### For Companies

- AI systems that truly serve customers better over time
- Measurable ROI from customer satisfaction improvements
- Competitive advantage through customer-driven AI excellence
- Predictable customer success outcomes

## How It Works

Our platform uses **graders** - evaluation specifications that define what good
AI behavior looks like from a customer success perspective:

```markdown
# Customer Support Response Grader

Evaluate customer support responses for satisfaction and resolution quality.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Addresses customer's specific concern directly
- Provides clear, actionable next steps
- Maintains professional, empathetic tone
- Resolves issue or escalates appropriately

## Scoring Guidelines

- **+3**: Perfect customer experience, issue fully resolved
- **+1**: Good response, minor customer experience improvements possible
- **-1**: Adequate but customer could be more satisfied
- **-3**: Poor customer experience, likely to generate complaint

![customer feedback samples](./customer-support-context-and-samples.deck.toml)
```

The scoring system (-3 to +3) gives you precise control over customer
satisfaction outcomes.

## Customer Success in Action
