## What is Content Foundry?

Content Foundry is an open-source platform designed to help creators tell their
story across all platforms, including their own. Content Foundry has five
pillars, each describing a step of the content creation process.

### Story Bank

Take anecdotes, inspirations, ideas, user research, sales calls, and whatever
information you have that relates to your brand and put it here. This serves as
origin material for the rest of the process.

### Idea Generator

Figure out what you should say before you say it. Come up with sketches,
outlines or other ideas for tweets, posts, videos, etc.

### Content Editor

Write your content.

### Community

Get your content where it needs to go

### Analytics dashboard

Learn what works with your audience, and feed it back into the process.

## Developer experience

We want to create the best ever developer experience. We want it to be simpler
to contribute to Content Foundry than it is to contribute to Wikipedia. We're
not there yet, but here's what we do have.

### Replit-first developer experience

The best way to get started with Content Foundry is to
[head to our replit app](https://replit.com/t/bolt-foundry/repls/Content-Foundry/view)

From there, you can fork (they call it remix now) our app into your own replit
account.
