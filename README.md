# Bolt Foundry

We're building structured prompt engineering. Instead of text strings,
developers compose AI from cards with examples and specs that make it reliable.

## What are assistant cards?

Assistant cards turn AI instructions into testable specifications:

- **Persona cards**: Define who the AI should be (traits, voice, constraints)
- **Behavior cards**: Define what the AI should do (goals, steps, formats)
- **Examples**: Show good and bad behaviors with -3 to +3 ratings
- **Specifications**: Break down requirements into clear, testable units
