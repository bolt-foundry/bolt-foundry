# Bolt Foundry

We're building structured prompt engineering. Instead of text strings,
developers compose AI from decks of cards with examples and specs that make it
reliable.

## The Deck System

Our deck system brings structured engineering to LLM applications:

- **Decks**: Composable collections of cards that define specific AI behaviors
- **Cards**: Hierarchical specifications organized by category (persona,
  behavior, etc.)
- **Specs**: Clear, testable requirements that define precise AI capabilities
- **Context**: Structured information that guides AI understanding and responses
- **Samples**: Rated examples (-3 to +3) showing good and bad behaviors

## What are assistant cards?

Assistant cards turn AI instructions into testable specifications:

- **Persona cards**: Define who the AI should be (traits, voice, constraints)
- **Behavior cards**: Define what the AI should do (goals, steps, formats)
- **Examples**: Show good and bad behaviors with -3 to +3 ratings
- **Specifications**: Break down requirements into clear, testable units
