A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The U.S. Open golf win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but naming only six players (and likely not major stars yet) is not a huge headline. There are no major weak stories, but two are notably less relevant for casual fans. Overall, the selection is decent but not elite, with some weak spots.",

The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event's prestige and drama give it some casual fan interest.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement is a routine schedule update for a non-premier college basketball program. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is a minor personnel/strategy update about a rookie QB and a non-marquee team. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine injury update for a pitcher who is not a major star.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\\"id\\\",\\\"source_id\\\",\\\"title\\\",\\\"content\\\",\\\"url\\\",\\\"published_at\\\",\\\"scraped_at\\\",\\\"relevance_score\\\"\\n\\\"9\\\",\\\"7\\\",\\\"What do we really know about Michael Penix Jr.?

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement features prominent players like Auston Matthews, which adds star power. The David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade involves a major MLB team and a well-known former player, adding some interest. The NFL 25-year best roster is more of a retrospective piece, which may not have immediate relevance but includes major stars. The WNBA story, while covering a league event, lacks the star power or major storyline to elevate its relevance.

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list -

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

The David Ortiz/Red Sox/Devers trade story is less relevant‚ÄîOrtiz is a retired star commenting on a trade, which is not as strong as an actual major trade or game result.

Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the prominence of the Yankees. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a golf major victory, which is tier 1 content.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

                          The selection includes a mix of stories with varying
                          levels of starpower and interest. The trade of Rafael
                          Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a high-profile
                          story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton's
                          return is notable due to his prominence with the
                          Yankees. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a major event
                          in golf, though Spaun himself may not have widespread
                          starpower. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers
                          and Thunder is relevant, but the teams lack the
                          starpower of more prominent franchises. The U.S.
                          hockey roster announcement has limited immediate

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a high-profile story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a major event in golf, though Spaun himself may not have widespread starpower. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is relevant, but the teams lack the starpower of more prominent franchises. The U.S. hockey roster announcement has limited immediate interest. Overall, the selection has some strong stories but also notable weak spots, particularly in terms of starpower and casual fan interest.&quot;

                          The selection includes multiple stories with minimal
                          starpower and limited broad appeal. The story about
                          the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year entering
                          the transfer portal and the Cardinals' minicamp update

                          interest casual fans. The Katie Boulter tennis story,
                          while featuring a national player, does not involve a
                          major star or event. The Simone Biles story has some
                          starpower due to her prominence, but the context is
                          not directly related to a major sporting event. The
                          Chicago Sky story involves a significant injury but
                          lacks the starpower of more prominent teams or
                          players. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche
                          or minor stories with limited relevance to a broad
                          audience.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                          Haliburton injury story is timely and relevant due to
                          its impact on the NBA Finals, but Haliburton is not a
                          Tier 1 star. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement
                          features prominent players like Auston Matthews, which
                          is of interest to hockey fans. The David Ortiz and

                          player and a current star, appealing to MLB fans. The
                          NFL all-time team story includes major stars like Tom
                          Brady, which has broad appeal. However, the WNBA

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                          Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve
                          high-profile MLB teams, appealing to a broad audience.
                          The Panthers' Stanley Cup win and Tyrese Haliburton's
                          injury status in the NBA Finals are timely and involve

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve high-profile MLB teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers&#39; Stanley Cup win and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals are timely and involve prominent teams and players. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while less prominent, still holds some interest due to the major title win. Overall, the selection is strong, with only minor weak spots in terms of starpower.&quot;

                          The selection of stories lacks significant starpower
                          and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke's top
                          freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major
                          star with widespread interest. The other stories focus
                          on niche topics or less prominent figures, such as a
                          PGA expert's pick, a college basketball schedule
                          announcement, and a UFC commentator's return. These
                          stories do not have strong casual fan interest or
                          feature major stars or teams. Additionally, there are
                          two golf-related stories, which may not appeal to a
                          broad audience. Overall, the selection is below
                          average in terms of relevance for sports fans.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke&#39;s top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star with widespread interest. The other stories focus on niche topics or less prominent figures, such as a PGA expert&#39;s pick, a college basketball schedule announcement, and a UFC commentator&#39;s return. These stories do not have strong casual fan interest or feature major stars or teams. Additionally, there are two golf-related stories, which may not appeal to a broad audience. Overall, the selection is below average in terms of relevance for sports fans.&quot;

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. None of the stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams. The stories about Robert MacIntyre in golf and Michael Bisping in UFC lack widespread interest for casual sports fans. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and the Broncos&#39; defensive strategy are niche topics with limited appeal. The Astros&#39; injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is a routine personnel update. Overall, the selection fails to include stories with significant starpower or high casual fan interest, resulting in a below-average selection.&quot;

                          The selection includes several stories with
                          significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red
                          Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating
                          Giancarlo Stanton both involve major MLB stars and
                          teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers
                          winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the
                          NHL. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA
                          Finals is relevant due to the high stakes of the game.
                          J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks
                          the same level of starpower as the other stories.
                          Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but
                          the inclusion of a less prominent golf story slightly
                          reduces the overall score.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve major MLB stars and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals is relevant due to the high stakes of the game. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a less prominent golf story slightly reduces the overall score.&quot;

                          Three stories have strong starpower and broad
                          interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big
                          teams), Giancarlo Stanton's return (Yankees star), and
                          the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real,
                          current event with major teams/players). The U.S. Open
                          golf win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun
                          himself is not a household name, so starpower is
                          moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement
                          is timely and has some national interest, but naming
                          only six players (and likely not major stars yet) is
                          not a huge headline. There are no major weak stories,
                          but two are notably less relevant for casual fans.
                          Overall, the selection is decent but not elite, with
                          some weak spots.

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Three stories have strong starpower and broad interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big teams), Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return (Yankees star), and the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event with major teams/players). The U.S. Open golf win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but naming only six players (and likely not major stars yet) is not a huge headline. There are no major weak stories, but two are notably less relevant for casual fans. Overall, the selection is decent but not elite, with some weak spots.&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

{
  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with minimal starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Simone Biles story (major star, cross-sport appeal) and possibly the Angel Reese/Chicago Sky story (rising WNBA star, but not yet a household name) have broad relevance. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars mentioned. Katie Boulter, while a national No. 1, is not a global tennis star and her Queen&#39;s win is not a major headline. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche and irrelevant to most fans. With 3+ stories lacking starpower and broad appeal, this selection warrants a -2 score per the guidelines.&quot;

                          Four of the five stories have strong starpower and
                          broad appeal: Haliburton's injury in the NBA Finals
                          (major star, huge event), US Hockey Olympic roster
                          (features Matthews and Tkachuk brothers, big names for
                          hockey fans and Olympics), David Ortiz commenting on a
                          Red Sox trade (Ortiz is a household name, Red Sox are
                          a major franchise), and the NFL all-time 25-year team
                          (features legends like Brady, Moss, etc., high casual
                          fan interest). The WNBA Commissioner's Cup story is
                          the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus
                          and is more niche, but the league's rising profile and
                          the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it
                          from being irrelevant. Overall, this is a strong,
                          relevant selection with only one notable weak spot.

If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: Haliburton&#39;s injury in the NBA Finals (major star, huge event), US Hockey Olympic roster (features Matthews and Tkachuk brothers, big names for hockey fans and Olympics), David Ortiz commenting on a Red Sox trade (Ortiz is a household name, Red Sox are a major franchise), and the NFL all-time 25-year team (features legends like Brady, Moss, etc., high casual fan interest). The WNBA Commissioner&#39;s Cup story is the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus and is more niche, but the league&#39;s rising profile and the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it from being irrelevant. Overall, this is a strong, relevant selection with only one notable weak spot.&quot;

                          Four of the five stories have strong starpower and
                          broad appeal: the Devers trade (major MLB star, Red
                          Sox and Giants are prominent teams), Panthers winning
                          the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features a major
                          event and likely stars), Haliburton's injury status
                          for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and
                          Stanton's return for the Yankees (major MLB star,
                          Yankees are a marquee franchise). The U.S. Open win by
                          J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, but Spaun himself is
                          not a household name, making this the weakest of the
                          five. However, the event's prestige and drama give it
                          some casual fan interest. There are no major weak or
                          niche stories, so this is a strong, relevant
                          selection, but not perfect due to the lack of a
                          superstar in the golf story.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Devers trade (major MLB star, Red Sox and Giants are prominent teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features a major event and likely stars), Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, Yankees are a marquee franchise). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event&#39;s prestige and drama give it some casual fan interest. There are no major weak or niche stories, so this is a strong, relevant selection, but not perfect due to the lack of a superstar in the golf story.&quot;

If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has strong starpower and some broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun and the Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) both lack major starpower, as neither golfer is a household name. The Oklahoma SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine conference update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche broadcasting update, not a major fight or star-driven story. With at least three stories lacking significant starpower or broad appeal, this selection is well below average for a general sports audience.&quot;

                          The selection contains mostly minor or niche stories
                          with little broad appeal. The Travelers Championship
                          pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks starpower, as MacIntyre
                          is not a household name. The UFC story is about a
                          commentator (Michael Bisping) returning, not a major
                          fight or star athlete. The Oklahoma SEC basketball
                          opponents announcement is a routine schedule update
                          for a non-premier college basketball program. The
                          Broncos/Bo Nix story is a minor personnel/strategy
                          update about a rookie QB and a non-marquee team. The
                          Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine injury
                          update for a pitcher who is not a major star. There
                          are no Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and at least
                          three stories have minimal starpower. This fits the -2
                          range: most stories are minor/niche with little broad
                          appeal, with few redeeming stories.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains mostly minor or niche stories with little broad appeal. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks starpower, as MacIntyre is not a household name. The UFC story is about a commentator (Michael Bisping) returning, not a major fight or star athlete. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement is a routine schedule update for a non-premier college basketball program. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is a minor personnel/strategy update about a rookie QB and a non-marquee team. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine injury update for a pitcher who is not a major star. There are no Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and at least three stories have minimal starpower. This fits the -2 range: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with few redeeming stories.&quot;

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, huge franchises), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, recent and dramatic), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, high-stakes game), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant golf event, but Spaun himself lacks major starpower, making this the weakest of the five. However, the overall selection is highly relevant and newsworthy for sports fans, with only one notable weak spot.&quot;

                          The selection includes several high-relevance stories:
                          the trade of All-Star Rafael Devers is a major MLB
                          event, and J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a Tier 1 golf
                          major victory, both of which have high starpower and
                          casual fan interest. The NBA Finals game is also a
                          high-interest event. The story about Giancarlo
                          Stanton's return is less impactful but involves a
                          prominent player. The U.S. hockey roster announcement
                          is less relevant but not enough to significantly
                          detract from the overall selection. Overall, 4 out of
                          5 stories have strong relevance, justifying a score of
                          +2.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

                          The selection includes a mix of stories with varying
                          levels of relevance. The Tyrese Haliburton injury
                          update is relevant due to its impact on the NBA
                          Finals, but injury updates generally have lower casual
                          fan interest. The US Hockey Olympic roster
                          announcement features prominent players like Auston
                          Matthews, which adds star power. The David Ortiz
                          commentary on the Rafael Devers trade involves a major
                          MLB team and a well-known former player, adding some
                          interest. The NFL 25-year best roster is more of a
                          retrospective piece, which may not have immediate
                          relevance but includes major stars. The WNBA story,
                          while covering a league event, lacks the star power or
                          major storyline to elevate its relevance. Overall,
                          there are 2-3 stories with decent relevance, but the
                          selection has notable weak spots, particularly with
                          the WNBA and injury update stories.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of relevance. The Tyrese Haliburton injury update is relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, but injury updates generally have lower casual fan interest. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement features prominent players like Auston Matthews, which adds star power. The David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade involves a major MLB team and a well-known former player, adding some interest. The NFL 25-year best roster is more of a retrospective piece, which may not have immediate relevance but includes major stars. The WNBA story, while covering a league event, lacks the star power or major storyline to elevate its relevance. Overall, there are 2-3 stories with decent relevance, but the selection has notable weak spots, particularly with the WNBA and injury update stories.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

The Travelers Championship prediction is low starpower content, the ranking of Duke freshmen is niche college basketball content, the announcement of SEC basketball opponents is routine and lacks broad appeal, and the return of Michael Bisping for UFC commentary is trivial. With 4 weak stories, the selection must be scored as -3.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

The stories about Robert MacIntyre&#39;s prediction for the Travelers Championship, Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary, Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents, Sean Payton&#39;s comments on the Broncos&#39; defense, and Lance McCullers Jr.&#39;s injury update all fall into categories of low starpower and casual fan interest.

                          The selection of stories is highly relevant and
                          features major stars and teams. The first story about
                          J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a Tier 1 golf
                          major victory, which is highly significant. The second
                          story involves a blockbuster trade of All-Star Rafael
                          Devers, which is a major MLB event. The third story
                          covers the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup, a
                          high-profile NHL event. The fourth story discusses
                          Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals,
                          involving a key player in a critical game. The fifth
                          story features Giancarlo Stanton, a well-known MLB
                          player, returning to play for the Yankees, a prominent
                          team. All stories have high casual fan interest and
                          timeliness, making this a strong selection.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories is highly relevant and features major stars and teams. The first story about J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a Tier 1 golf major victory, which is highly significant. The second story involves a blockbuster trade of All-Star Rafael Devers, which is a major MLB event. The third story covers the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup, a high-profile NHL event. The fourth story discusses Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals, involving a key player in a critical game. The fifth story features Giancarlo Stanton, a well-known MLB player, returning to play for the Yankees, a prominent team. All stories have high casual fan interest and timeliness, making this a strong selection.&quot;

                          Four of the five stories are highly relevant for
                          sports fans: (1) the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael
                          Devers is a major MLB move involving a star and
                          prominent teams; (2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open
                          is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content; (3)
                          the NBA Finals Game 5 is a top-tier event with broad
                          interest; (5) Giancarlo Stanton's return for the
                          Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team's
                          prominence. The only weaker story is the U.S. hockey
                          naming six players for the 2026 Olympics, which is
                          more of a routine roster update and lacks immediate
                          starpower or drama. Since 4+ stories are tier 1 or
                          close, this selection earns a +2.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant for sports fans: (1) the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers is a major MLB move involving a star and prominent teams; (2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content; (3) the NBA Finals Game 5 is a top-tier event with broad interest; (5) Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team&#39;s prominence. The only weaker story is the U.S. hockey naming six players for the 2026 Olympics, which is more of a routine roster update and lacks immediate starpower or drama. Since 4+ stories are tier 1 or close, this selection earns a +2.&quot;

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

{
  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are weak according to the grading criteria. The Simone Biles story is a minor controversy, not a substantive sports achievement. The Chicago Sky story is a WNBA injury update, not a major star or historic moment. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel/injury update. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a non-household name in a non-major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a college move with low starpower. With 5 weak stories, this selection mandates a -3 score.&quot;

                          Three stories have decent starpower and casual fan
                          interest: Haliburton's injury ahead of the NBA Finals
                          (major event, though Haliburton is not a true
                          household name but the context is big), the US Hockey
                          Olympic roster announcement (features big names like
                          Matthews and the Tkachuk brothers, and the Olympics
                          are a major event), and the NFL 25-year all-star
                          roster (features major stars and is a fun,
                          broad-interest topic). The David Ortiz/Red Sox/Devers
                          trade story is less relevant‚ÄîOrtiz is a retired star
                          commenting on a trade, which is not as strong as an
                          actual major trade or game result. The WNBA
                          Commissioner's Cup story is routine league content
                          without a major star or historic moment, so it is a
                          weak story. With 2 weak stories and 3 solid ones, this
                          fits the +1 score: 3+ stories have decent relevance,
                          but the selection has notable weak spots.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

                          storyline involving a star player in the league's
                          biggest series. Giancarlo Stanton's return for the
                          Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the
                          prominence of the Yankees. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S.
                          Open is a golf major victory, which is tier 1 content.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events with strong casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers is a blockbuster MLB move involving a household name and a storied franchise. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major NHL event. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals is a key storyline involving a star player in the league&#39;s biggest series. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the prominence of the Yankees. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a golf major victory, which is tier 1 content. All stories are timely, involve major sports, and would be of high interest to sports fans.&quot;

                          Four of the five selected stories are weak by the
                          mandatory checklist: (1) PGA expert pick for the
                          Travelers Championship is a low-starpower, routine
                          golf prediction (not a major win); (2) Duke freshmen
                          ranking is a college basketball listicle, not a major
                          event or star-driven news; (3) Oklahoma SEC basketball
                          opponents announcement is a routine schedule update;
                          (4) Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is a
                          commentator news story, not a major sports event. Only
                          the U.S. Open win (J.J. Spaun) is tier 1 content. With
                          4+ weak stories, the score must be -3 according to the
                          rules.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five selected stories are weak by the mandatory checklist: (1) PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is a low-starpower, routine golf prediction (not a major win); (2) Duke freshmen ranking is a college basketball listicle, not a major event or star-driven news; (3) Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement is a routine schedule update; (4) Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is a commentator news story, not a major sports event. Only the U.S. Open win (J.J. Spaun) is tier 1 content. With 4+ weak stories, the score must be -3 according to the rules.&quot;

If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are weak in terms of starpower and casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship expert pick is not a golf major and features a non-household name (Robert MacIntyre), which is low starpower. Michael Bisping returning to commentary is a routine broadcast update, not a major UFC fight or star storyline. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college sports update. Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos&#39; defense is a minor NFL offseason story, not a major trade or star move. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine MLB injury update, not a star-driven or high-impact story. All five stories fit the checklist for weak content, triggering the mandatory -3 score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;
