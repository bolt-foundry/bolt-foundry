A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The U.S. Open golf win is a major event, but J.J. Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but unless it includes major NHL stars (not specified), it lacks broad appeal. The selection avoids major penalties, but the inclusion of two stories with only moderate starpower keeps it from a higher score.",

The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major golf event but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the event itself is significant. All stories are timely and of high interest to casual fans. The selection is very strong, but not perfect due to the slightly lower starpower of Spaun compared to the others.",

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major golf event but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the event itself is significant. All stories are timely and of high interest to casual fans.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher who is not a major star.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is notable but lacks broad starpower. The NBA Finals mention is relevant but lacks detail on star players. The U.S. hockey roster announcement is timely but not highly engaging for casual fans.

The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major MLB story, and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton, a well-known player, adds to the starpower. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals is relevant due to the high stakes of the game. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, is less impactful in terms of starpower compared to the other stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The J.J. Spaun U.S. Open win is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is lacking. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is a routine update with no stars named, so low starpower and interest. The selection is held back by two weak stories (Spaun and hockey roster), but the presence of two major MLB stories and an NBA Finals game keeps it above average. Thus, +1 is appropriate.",

The Chicago Sky story involves Angel Reese (a rising star) and Courtney Vandersloot (a WNBA veteran), but WNBA stories generally have less broad appeal unless they involve major events or superstars like Caitlin Clark. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story lacks starpower, as she is not a household name, and the Queen's tournament is not a major event.

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

                          The selection includes several stories with
                          significant starpower and casual fan interest. The
                          trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major story
                          with high relevance. Giancarlo Stanton's return is
                          notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. The
                          U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun, while not featuring a
                          major star, is a significant event in golf. The NBA
                          Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly
                          relevant, though the teams are not the most prominent.
                          The U.S. hockey roster announcement has some interest
                          but is less impactful. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple stories with minimal starpower and broad appeal. The story about Simone Biles (articleId 36) is the only one featuring a major star with potential casual fan interest. The Chicago Sky story (articleId 42) involves a significant injury but lacks major starpower. The Cardinals minicamp update (articleId 32) and the Southern Conference transfer portal story (articleId 48) are routine updates with minimal relevance to casual fans. The Katie Boulter story (articleId 38) involves a moderate-level tennis player with limited appeal. Overall, the selection lacks prominent stars and fails to capture broad interest, with multiple stories being niche or routine updates.&quot;

                          The selection includes several high-profile stories
                          with significant starpower and casual fan interest.
                          The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player)
                          and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star)
                          both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large
                          fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the
                          uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals
                          are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J.
                          Spaun's U.S. Open win, while less prominent, still
                          holds interest due to the nature of a major golf
                          tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong
                          relevance, with only the golf story being slightly
                          less impactful in terms of starpower.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several high-profile stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win, while less prominent, still holds interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with only the golf story being slightly less impactful in terms of starpower.&quot;

                          The selection of stories lacks significant starpower
                          and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion
                          Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some
                          starpower, the other stories are weak in terms of
                          major stars or teams. The golf stories about J.J.
                          Spaun and Robert MacIntyre, while notable in the golf
                          world, do not feature major stars with widespread
                          appeal. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents
                          announcement and Michael Bisping's return for UFC
                          commentary are niche stories with limited casual fan
                          interest. Overall, the selection fails to include
                          enough high-profile stories to engage a broad sports
                          audience.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are weak in terms of major stars or teams. The golf stories about J.J. Spaun and Robert MacIntyre, while notable in the golf world, do not feature major stars with widespread appeal. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary are niche stories with limited casual fan interest. Overall, the selection fails to include enough high-profile stories to engage a broad sports audience.&quot;

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The stories include a PGA expert&#39;s pick, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and they lack significant casual fan interest.

                          The selection includes several stories with
                          significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red
                          Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating
                          Giancarlo Stanton both involve prominent MLB players
                          and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers
                          winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey,
                          and Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is crucial for
                          the NBA Finals, both of which are timely and relevant.
                          J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while less prominent
                          than the others, still holds interest due to the
                          nature of a major golf title. Overall, 4 out of 5
                          stories have strong relevance, with only the golf
                          story being slightly less impactful in terms of
                          starpower.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve prominent MLB players and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey, and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is crucial for the NBA Finals, both of which are timely and relevant. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while less prominent than the others, still holds interest due to the nature of a major golf title. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with only the golf story being slightly less impactful in terms of starpower.&quot;

                          Three stories have strong starpower and broad
                          interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big
                          teams), Giancarlo Stanton's return (Yankees star), and
                          the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real,
                          current event with major teams/players, though the
                          article wasn't in the provided list). The U.S. Open
                          golf win is a major event, but J.J. Spaun is not a
                          household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S.
                          hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has
                          some national interest, but unless it includes major
                          NHL stars (not specified), it lacks broad appeal. The
                          selection avoids major penalties, but the inclusion of
                          two stories with only moderate starpower keeps it from
                          a higher score.

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Three stories have strong starpower and broad interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big teams), Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return (Yankees star), and the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event with major teams/players, though the article wasn&#39;t in the provided list). The U.S. Open golf win is a major event, but J.J. Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but unless it includes major NHL stars (not specified), it lacks broad appeal. The selection avoids major penalties, but the inclusion of two stories with only moderate starpower keeps it from a higher score.&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with minimal starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Simone Biles story (major star, cross-sport appeal) and possibly the Chicago Sky/Angel Reese story (rising WNBA star, but the focus is on Vandersloot, who is less of a household name) have notable relevance. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars mentioned. The Katie Boulter tennis story and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story are both niche, with Boulter lacking global starpower and the college baseball transfer being highly minor. There are 2+ stories (Boulter, Pitcher transfer) with minimal starpower, and another (Cardinals) is a routine update, triggering a harsh penalty. Overall, the group is below average for a general sports fan.&quot;

                          Four of the five stories have strong starpower and
                          broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael
                          Devers (major MLB star, big-market teams), the
                          Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship,
                          features stars and a major event), Tyrese Haliburton's
                          injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA
                          Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the
                          Yankees (household name, major team). The fifth story,
                          J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major golf
                          event but Spaun himself is not a household name, which
                          slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the
                          event itself is significant. All stories are timely
                          and of high interest to casual fans. The selection is
                          very strong, but not perfect due to the slightly lower
                          starpower of Spaun compared to the others.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big-market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features stars and a major event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (household name, major team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major golf event but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the event itself is significant. All stories are timely and of high interest to casual fans. The selection is very strong, but not perfect due to the slightly lower starpower of Spaun compared to the others.&quot;

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant golf event, but Spaun is not a household name, and the Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche betting story about a non-star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche broadcasting note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (Travelers pick, Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.&quot;

                          The selection contains mostly minor or niche stories
                          with little broad appeal. The Travelers Championship
                          pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks starpower, as MacIntyre
                          is not a household name. The UFC story is about a
                          commentator (Michael Bisping) returning, not a major
                          fight or star athlete. The Oklahoma SEC basketball
                          opponents announcement is a routine schedule update
                          with no major stars or drama. The Broncos/Bo Nix story
                          is about a rookie QB and a coach's opinion, not a
                          headline-grabbing event. The Astros' Lance McCullers
                          Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher
                          who is not a major star. At least three stories have
                          minimal starpower, and none are likely to generate
                          significant casual fan interest. This fits the -2
                          level: most stories are minor/niche with little broad
                          appeal, few redeeming stories.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains mostly minor or niche stories with little broad appeal. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks starpower, as MacIntyre is not a household name. The UFC story is about a commentator (Michael Bisping) returning, not a major fight or star athlete. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement is a routine schedule update with no major stars or drama. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach&#39;s opinion, not a headline-grabbing event. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher who is not a major star. At least three stories have minimal starpower, and none are likely to generate significant casual fan interest. This fits the -2 level: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.&quot;

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, NHL stars), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant sports event, but Spaun himself lacks major starpower, making this the weakest of the five. However, the overall selection is highly relevant and newsworthy for sports fans, with only one notable weak spot.&quot;

                          story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton's

                          notable but lacks broad starpower. The NBA Finals
                          mention is relevant but lacks detail on star players.
                          The U.S. hockey roster announcement is timely but not
                          highly engaging for casual fans. Overall, 3 stories

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

                          The selection includes several stories with
                          significant starpower and team prominence. The trade
                          of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major MLB story,
                          and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton, a
                          well-known player, adds to the starpower. The Panthers
                          winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the
                          NHL. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA
                          Finals is relevant due to the high stakes of the game.
                          J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, is less
                          impactful in terms of starpower compared to the other
                          stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong
                          relevance and interest, but the selection is slightly
                          weakened by the inclusion of a golf story with less
                          broad appeal.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and team prominence. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major MLB story, and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton, a well-known player, adds to the starpower. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals is relevant due to the high stakes of the game. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while notable, is less impactful in terms of starpower compared to the other stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance and interest, but the selection is slightly weakened by the inclusion of a golf story with less broad appeal.&quot;

                          The selection of stories lacks significant starpower
                          and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke's top
                          freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major
                          star and prominent team, which is relevant to casual
                          fans. The other stories focus on niche or less
                          prominent sports and figures: J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open
                          win, Robert MacIntyre's PGA backing, Oklahoma's SEC
                          basketball schedule, and Michael Bisping's return to
                          UFC commentary. These stories do not feature household
                          names or high-profile teams that would interest a wide
                          audience. The selection is dominated by niche sports
                          and non-stars, triggering a negative score.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke&#39;s top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star and prominent team, which is relevant to casual fans. The other stories focus on niche or less prominent sports and figures: J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win, Robert MacIntyre&#39;s PGA backing, Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule, and Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary. These stories do not feature household names or high-profile teams that would interest a wide audience. The selection is dominated by niche sports and non-stars, triggering a negative score.&quot;

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert backing a golfer, a UFC commentator returning, a college basketball schedule announcement, a coach&#39;s opinion on a defense, and an injury update for a baseball player. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest. Additionally, the stories do not have strong casual fan interest or dramatic storylines. The selection is dominated by routine updates and niche sports content, which do not appeal to a broad audience.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and team prominence. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton involve major MLB teams and well-known players, appealing to casual fans. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are also high-interest stories involving prominent teams and players. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win, while notable, involves a less prominent player, slightly reducing the overall starpower. However, the selection overall maintains strong relevance and interest for sports fans.&quot;

                          Three stories have strong or decent relevance: the Red
                          Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major star/team,
                          high interest), the Pacers vs. Thunder NBA Finals Game
                          5 (assuming this is a real, current event, it would be
                          highly relevant), and Giancarlo Stanton's return
                          (major star, but routine injury return is low
                          interest). The J.J. Spaun U.S. Open win is a major
                          event, but Spaun is not a household name, so starpower
                          is lacking. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster
                          announcement is a routine update with no stars named,
                          so low starpower and interest. The selection is held
                          back by two weak stories (Spaun and hockey roster),
                          but the presence of two major MLB stories and an NBA
                          Finals game keeps it above average. Thus, +1 is
                          appropriate.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Three stories have strong or decent relevance: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major star/team, high interest), the Pacers vs. Thunder NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event, it would be highly relevant), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return (major star, but routine injury return is low interest). The J.J. Spaun U.S. Open win is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is lacking. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is a routine update with no stars named, so low starpower and interest. The selection is held back by two weak stories (Spaun and hockey roster), but the presence of two major MLB stories and an NBA Finals game keeps it above average. Thus, +1 is appropriate.&quot;

                          The selection contains multiple stories with low
                          starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone
                          Biles story, while involving a major star, is a
                          trivial controversy/apology rather than meaningful
                          sports news, which is specifically penalized. The
                          Chicago Sky story involves Angel Reese (a rising star)
                          and Courtney Vandersloot (a WNBA veteran), but WNBA
                          stories generally have less broad appeal unless they
                          involve major events or superstars like Caitlin Clark.
                          The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel
                          story with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter
                          tennis story lacks starpower, as she is not a
                          household name, and the Queen's tournament is not a
                          major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the
                          Year transfer portal story is a classic example of a
                          minor college update with no broad appeal. With 3+
                          stories about non-household names and two stories
                          (college transfer, routine minicamp) that are
                          especially weak, this selection fits the -2 criteria:
                          most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal,
                          with few redeeming stories.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles story, while involving a major star, is a trivial controversy/apology rather than meaningful sports news, which is specifically penalized. The Chicago Sky story involves Angel Reese (a rising star) and Courtney Vandersloot (a WNBA veteran), but WNBA stories generally have less broad appeal unless they involve major events or superstars like Caitlin Clark. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story lacks starpower, as she is not a household name, and the Queen&#39;s tournament is not a major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a classic example of a minor college update with no broad appeal. With 3+ stories about non-household names and two stories (college transfer, routine minicamp) that are especially weak, this selection fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with few redeeming stories.&quot;

                          Three stories are strong: the Devers trade (major MLB
                          star, big teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup
                          (championship, high-profile event), and Haliburton's
                          injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, major
                          event). The Stanton return is a routine injury update,
                          even though he's a star, so it has low casual fan
                          interest. The J.J. Spaun U.S. Open win is a major
                          event, but Spaun is not a household name, so it lacks
                          starpower. The selection is solid but has notable weak
                          spots due to the inclusion of a routine injury return
                          and a non-star major event winner.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Three stories are strong: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, high-profile event), and Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, major event). The Stanton return is a routine injury update, even though he&#39;s a star, so it has low casual fan interest. The J.J. Spaun U.S. Open win is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name, so it lacks starpower. The selection is solid but has notable weak spots due to the inclusion of a routine injury return and a non-star major event winner.&quot;

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection is dominated by stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has genuine starpower and some broad appeal. The U.S. Open winner J.J. Spaun and Robert MacIntyre for the Travelers Championship are not household names and have little cross-sport interest. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no major stars. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is a niche UFC broadcast story, not a major sports event. At least three stories are about non-household names or minor updates, triggering an automatic -2 per the guidelines.&quot;

                          The selection is dominated by routine updates and

                          the five stories feature major stars or prominent
                          teams in a way that would interest casual fans: (1)
                          Robert MacIntyre is not a household name in golf, and
                          expert picks for a regular PGA event have low
                          interest; (2) Michael Bisping's return to commentary
                          is a niche UFC broadcast update, not a major sports
                          story; (3) Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule
                          announcement is a routine college update with no
                          starpower; (4) Sean Payton's comments about Bo Nix and
                          the Broncos' defense is a minor NFL offseason note
                          about a rookie QB and a non-marquee team; (5) Lance
                          McCullers Jr. being placed on the IL is a routine
                          injury update for a non-star pitcher. There are at
                          least 4 stories with zero household names and no high
                          casual fan interest, triggering an automatic -3.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection is dominated by routine updates and stories with little starpower or broad appeal. None of the five stories feature major stars or prominent teams in a way that would interest casual fans: (1) Robert MacIntyre is not a household name in golf, and expert picks for a regular PGA event have low interest; (2) Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is a niche UFC broadcast update, not a major sports story; (3) Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no starpower; (4) Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos&#39; defense is a minor NFL offseason note about a rookie QB and a non-marquee team; (5) Lance McCullers Jr. being placed on the IL is a routine injury update for a non-star pitcher. There are at least 4 stories with zero household names and no high casual fan interest, triggering an automatic -3.&quot;

                          Four of the five stories are highly relevant for

                          Devers (major MLB star, huge team), Panthers winning
                          the Stanley Cup (championship, major event), Tyrese

                          player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return
                          for the Yankees (household name, top franchise). The
                          U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but
                          Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly
                          lowers the overall starpower. However, the selection
                          is strong overall, with only one story (Spaun) lacking
                          top-tier starpower, so +2 is appropriate.

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even Simone Biles\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content involving major stars should\n     be penalized for lack of meaningful sports content\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, golf, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes like Simone Biles\n  cannot redeem substantively empty content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant for sports fans: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, huge team), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, major event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (household name, top franchise). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the selection is strong overall, with only one story (Spaun) lacking top-tier starpower, so +2 is appropriate.&quot;
