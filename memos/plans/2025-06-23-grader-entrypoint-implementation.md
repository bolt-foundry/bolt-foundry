# Grader Entrypoint Implementation Plan

**Date**: 2025-06-23\
**Author**: Claude Code\
**Status**: In Progress ðŸš§\
**Related**: BoltFoundry web application, isograph architecture\
**Feature**: New Grader entrypoint for prompt evaluation and rating

## Executive Summary

This memo documents the implementation of a new "Grader" entrypoint in the
BoltFoundry web application. The Grader provides users with a simple interface
to input prompts, generate responses, and rate them with thumbs up/down
feedback. This implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase and
integrates seamlessly with the isograph architecture.

**Current Status**: Basic UI framework completed, but significant backend
integration and functionality still required.

## Background

The user requested a new entrypoint called "Grader" with the following
requirements:

- Prompt input interface
- Ability to run/execute the grader
- Results display in a list format
- Thumbs up/down rating system for each result
- Integration with existing BfDsLite design system

Two design options were provided via mockups, with Option 2 (streamlined
single-interface approach) selected for implementation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Architecture

The implementation follows the established isograph pattern used throughout
BoltFoundry:

```
EntrypointGrader (isograph entrypoint)
    â†“
Grader (React component)
    â†“
BfDsLiteButton + HTML elements
```

### 2. Files Created/Modified

#### New Files:

- `apps/boltFoundry/entrypoints/EntrypointGrader.ts` - Isograph entrypoint
  definition
- `apps/boltFoundry/components/Grader.tsx` - Main UI component

#### Modified Files:

- `apps/boltFoundry/routes.ts` - Added `/grader` route to isographAppRoutes
- `apps/boltFoundry/__generated__/builtRoutes.ts` - Auto-generated by build
  system

### 3. Technical Specifications

#### Component Features:

- **Prompt Input**: Large HTML textarea for prompt entry
- **Action Button**: BfDsLiteButton with "Go" text to trigger execution
- **Results Display**: HTML unordered list showing generated responses
- **Rating System**: BfDsLiteButton with `thumbUp` and `thumbDown` icons
- **State Management**: React useState for prompt, results, loading states
- **Responsive Design**: Flexbox layout with proper spacing and styling

#### Data Structure:

```typescript
type GraderResult = {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  rating: "thumbs-up" | "thumbs-down" | null;
};
```

#### Styling Approach:

- Used regular HTML elements (textarea, ul, li) as requested
- Leveraged CSS custom properties for theming consistency
- Implemented responsive design with proper spacing
- Used BfDsLite color variables for theme compatibility

### 4. User Experience

#### Workflow:

1. User enters prompt in textarea
2. User clicks "Go" button
3. Loading state displays "Generating results..."
4. Mock results appear in list format
5. User can rate each result with thumbs up/down buttons
6. Button states change to indicate selected rating

#### States:

- **Empty State**: Instructional text when no results
- **Loading State**: "Generating results..." during execution
- **Results State**: List of results with rating buttons
- **Button States**: Visual feedback for selected ratings

### 5. Integration Points

#### Routing:

- Route: `/grader`
- Entrypoint: `entrypointGrader`
- Added to `isographAppRoutes` Map

#### Build System:

- Automatic detection by `routesBuild.ts`
- Isograph compilation generates necessary artifacts
- Type safety through generated TypeScript types

## Mock Data Implementation

For initial implementation, the component uses mock data to simulate grader
results:

```javascript
const mockResults = [
  { id: "1", text: "You're dumb, water is liquid", rating: null },
  {
    id: "2",
    text: "Nice try, water is a liquid. You'll get it.",
    rating: null,
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    text: "Water is indeed a liquid at room temperature...",
    rating: null,
  },
];
```

This can be easily replaced with real API calls when backend functionality is
available.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks:

1. **Basic UI Framework**: Created EntrypointGrader and Grader component
2. **Route Integration**: Added `/grader` route to routing system
3. **Build System**: Generated isograph artifacts and types

## Conclusion

The Grader entrypoint foundation has been established following BoltFoundry's
patterns and best practices. While the basic UI framework is complete,
significant work remains to create a fully functional grading system.

**Current State**: A working UI prototype with mock data that demonstrates the
intended user experience and design patterns.

**Next Priority**: Backend integration and real data flow to transform this from
a prototype into a production-ready feature.

The implementation provides a solid architectural foundation that can be
extended with real functionality. The isograph architecture ensures type safety
and follows the project's standard approaches, making the remaining
implementation straightforward once backend services are defined.
