# Documentation & Planning System Implementation Summary

_Created: 2025-07-13_

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the Bolt Foundry
documentation and planning systems. The enhancements establish a robust,
AI-integrated documentation architecture that supports both human developers and
AI agents while maintaining clear organizational structure and workflow
efficiency.

## Overview of Documentation System Improvements

### Core Documentation Philosophy Implementation

The documentation system now implements a four-tier architecture based on
audience and purpose:

1. **`decks/`** - Structured behavior specifications for humans and AI
2. **`docs/`** - Public-facing user documentation and guides
3. **`memos/`** - Internal builder documentation and implementation plans
4. **`internal/`** - Team-specific knowledge base (planned)

This structure eliminates ambiguity about document purpose and audience while
creating clear pathways for information discovery.

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Audience Separation**: Clear distinction between users, builders, and team
  members
- **Temporal Organization**: Separation of evergreen content from dated
  plans/blogs
- **AI Integration**: Documentation serves both human and AI consumption
- **Structure as Product**: Documentation organization itself functions as a
  navigation system

## New Implementation Plans and Structure

### Enhanced Planning Document Framework

Implementation plans now follow a standardized structure with:

- **Date-prefixed naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`
- **Comprehensive status tracking**: Clear implementation phases and completion
  markers
- **Technical specifications**: Detailed architecture and dependency
  documentation
- **Success metrics**: Measurable outcomes and validation criteria
- **Risk mitigation**: Backward compatibility and performance considerations

### Advanced Implementation Plan Features

Recent plans demonstrate sophisticated documentation patterns:

1. **Multi-phase implementation tracking** with clear deliverables
2. **Technical architecture specifications** with code examples
3. **Integration documentation** showing system interactions
4. **Validation and testing strategies** for implementation verification
