# Advanced AI Workflow Implementation Plan

_Created: 2025-07-13_

## Overview

This plan outlines the implementation of sophisticated AI workflows that build
on the current AI agent infrastructure to provide specialized development
assistance through advanced conversation patterns and domain expertise.

## Analysis of Current Sophisticated Workflows

### âœ… Existing Advanced AI Decks

The codebase currently includes several sophisticated AI workflows:

#### 1. **Commit Message Generator** (`commit.md`)

- **Workflow**: Discovery â†’ Analysis â†’ Generation â†’ Execution
- **Integration**: Uses `bft sl status`, `bft sl diff`, `bft sl log` for context
- **Output**: Structured commit messages with specific format requirements
- **Context Management**: TOML-based parameter injection

#### 2. **Code Reviewer** (`code-reviewer.md`)

- **Approach**: Systematic analysis focusing on quality, technical issues, best
  practices
- **Output Format**: Structured review with summary, positives, prioritized
  issues
- **Educational Focus**: Explains "why" behind suggestions

#### 3. **Team Summary Analysis** (`team-summary-analysis.md`)

- **Complex Output**: Structured JSON with strict schema validation
- **Context Variables**: Dynamic substitution (`{{memberName}}`,
  `{{companyConnection}}`)
- **Business Intelligence**: Focuses on impact vs. activity metrics

#### 4. **Questions One-at-a-Time** (`questions-one-at-a-time.md`)

- **Strategy**: Progressive discovery through single focused questions
- **Conversation Flow**: Context â†’ Constraints â†’ Success â†’ Technical
- **Natural Interaction**: Avoids interrogative feel

### ðŸ”„ Patterns for New Advanced Workflows

Based on analysis of existing sophisticated workflows, successful patterns
include:

1. **Multi-Phase Approach**: Discovery â†’ Analysis â†’ Action â†’ Validation
2. **Tool Integration**: Deep integration with BFT commands and project context
3. **Structured Output**: JSON schemas for downstream processing
4. **Context Awareness**: Dynamic parameter injection and project-specific
   knowledge
5. **Educational Approach**: Focus on learning and improvement, not just task
   completion
