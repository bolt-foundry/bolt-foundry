# Resource Backlog

This folder contains future resources and documentation that need to be created
or acquired.

## Purpose

The backlog serves as a collection point for:

- Resources we plan to create
- Documentation we need to write
- External resources to acquire
- Templates and tools to develop

## How to Use This Folder

1. **Adding Items**: Drop new resource requests, drafts, or placeholders here
2. **Organizing**: Create subfolders by topic or priority as needed
3. **Processing**: When ready to work on an item, move it to the appropriate
   location in resources
4. **Tracking**: Use descriptive filenames and maintain a priority list

## Current Priorities

### High Priority

- Architecture diagrams and visual documentation
- API reference documentation
- Security guidelines and protocols

### Medium Priority

- Best practices guides
- Performance benchmarks
- Development templates

### Backlog Items

Place individual files or folders here for:

- Draft documentation
- Resource requests (as markdown files describing what's needed)
- Work-in-progress materials
- External resource links and references

## Workflow

1. Add new resource needs as files or folders
2. Include a brief description of what's needed
3. Tag with priority level if applicable
4. Move to main resources folder when complete
