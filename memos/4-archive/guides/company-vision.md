# Bolt Foundry company vision

## Mission

**Make AI systems continuously improve through customer feedback, creating
reliable, customer-centric AI that gets better every day.**

## The problem we're solving

Today's AI systems are built and deployed without meaningful connection to
customer feedback. Companies launch AI features, get complaints, and struggle to
translate customer dissatisfaction into systematic improvements... the
equivalent of building software without analytics, user testing, or iterative
design.

This creates four problems:

- **Disconnected systems**: AI behavior doesn't reflect actual customer needs
- **Unmeasurable impact**: No clear connection between AI changes and customer
  satisfaction
- **Untestable improvements**: Can't verify if changes actually help customers
- **Scaling challenges**: Each customer complaint requires manual investigation
  and custom fixes

AI applications deserve the same customer-centric improvement cycles as any
other customer-facing system.

## Why we're working on this

Our team has been building together for 7+ years, from our first company
Vidpresso (acquired by Facebook) through Content Foundry and now Bolt Foundry.
We discovered a consistent pattern: it's easy to build impressive AI demos, but
hard to scale them into systems that truly serve customers well.

Our team combines journalism, content creation, and technical expertise. The
same principles that make great content (understanding your audience, clear
structure, iterative improvement) make AI systems serve customers reliably.

The timing is perfect. Model improvements have plateaued since GPT-4, but
customer-driven improvement is wide open. Most companies accept "good enough"
customer satisfaction, but the ones who achieve customer-driven AI excellence
will dominate their markets. We're building the infrastructure to make that
possible.

## Our vision

**Bolt Foundry aims to be the customer success platform for AI**: the
foundational infrastructure every AI application needs for continuous
improvement through customer feedback.

Salesforce became the standard by making customer relationships manageable.
We're doing the same for AI customer success. Our RLHF workflow abstracts away
feedback processing complexity, making AI improvement predictable and scalable.

## How we see the future

### Today: The deployment-and-hope era

- Companies launch AI features without systematic feedback collection
- Each customer complaint is handled manually and individually
- Improvements are ad-hoc and don't leverage patterns across customers
- Success is measured by technical metrics, not customer satisfaction
- No clear path from feedback to systematic improvement

### Near-term vision: The customer-driven improvement era

- Companies systematically collect and process customer feedback on AI
  interactions
- Automated evaluation spec generation from customer feedback patterns
- Structured RLHF workflows that turn feedback into measurable improvements
- Customer satisfaction directly drives AI system optimization
- Shared libraries of proven customer success patterns

### Long-term vision: The customer success platform era

- Intelligent customer feedback processing and response optimization
- Real-time customer satisfaction insights
- Automated customer success quality assurance
- Enterprise-grade customer-driven AI improvement
- Ecosystem around customer-centric AI development

### The RLHF workflow system

Just like customer success platforms have structured processes for turning
feedback into improvements, our **customer feedback → evaluation specs →
improved AI responses** workflow provides:

- **Feedback collection**: Systematic capture of customer interactions and
  satisfaction signals through integrated feedback processing
- **Evaluation specs**: Automated generation of evaluation criteria from
  customer feedback patterns and satisfaction metrics
- **Response optimization**: Continuous improvement of AI responses based on
  customer success outcomes and feedback analysis
- **Success tracking**: Measurable outcomes connecting customer satisfaction to
  AI improvements through closed-loop feedback integration

## Why this matters

### For customer success teams

- Transform customer feedback into systematic AI improvements through our
  **customer feedback → evaluation specs → improved AI responses** workflow
- Measure and track customer satisfaction with AI interactions using structured
  feedback processing
- Identify patterns in customer needs and optimize AI responses based on success
  metrics
- Build customer-centric AI that continuously improves through RLHF integration

### For companies

- AI systems that truly serve customers better over time through continuous
  feedback integration
- Measurable ROI from customer satisfaction improvements using our RLHF workflow
- Competitive advantage through customer-driven AI excellence and systematic
  improvement
- Predictable customer success outcomes via the **customer feedback → evaluation
  specs → improved AI responses** workflow

### For the industry

- Make customer-centric AI development accessible through standardized RLHF
  workflows
- Establish best practices for customer-driven AI improvement via the **customer
  feedback → evaluation specs → improved AI responses** workflow
- Free companies to focus on unique value, not building feedback processing
  infrastructure from scratch
- Enable AI adoption in customer-critical applications through reliable,
  continuously improving systems

## Our principles

### Customer success first

Great AI systems are customer-driven, not just technically sound. They require
the same discipline, measurement, and iteration as any customer-facing system.

Our approach centers on
[improving AI through customer feedback](improving-inference-philosophy.md),
giving companies control over customer satisfaction through the **customer
feedback → evaluation specs → improved AI responses** workflow, not just hoping
the AI behaves correctly.

### Customer success team experience

Tools feel natural to customer success teams. We prioritize clarity,
measurability, and familiar workflows over technical abstractions.

### Gradual adoption

Companies shouldn't have to rebuild everything. Our tools provide migration
paths from existing manual feedback processes to automated customer success
workflows through the **customer feedback → evaluation specs → improved AI
responses** workflow.

### Open foundation

Core patterns and principles stay open and extensible. We build platforms, not
silos.

## What success looks like

We'll know we're succeeding when:

- Companies prefer customer-driven AI improvement over manual feedback handling
- AI systems achieve customer success-scale satisfaction (99%+ positive customer
  feedback)
- Customer success for AI becomes teachable through clear patterns, conventions,
  and measurable outcomes
- Enterprise adoption accelerates due to predictable, customer-centric systems
- An ecosystem emerges of shared customer success patterns and best practices

## The world we're building

We're working toward a world where:

- Deploying AI without customer feedback integration feels as archaic as
  launching products without analytics
- AI systems have the same customer satisfaction expectations as any
  customer-facing application
- Companies deploy AI systems confidently knowing they'll improve through
  customer feedback
- The next generation of AI applications is built on customer-centric,
  continuously improving foundations

**Bolt Foundry is building the tools to make this happen.**
