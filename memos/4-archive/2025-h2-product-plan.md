# 1. Executive Summary

Bolt Foundry is building the operating system for LLMs, transforming unreliable
prompt engineering into structured systems that achieve 99% reliability. We're a
five-person team with two paying customers at $1k/month each and validated
methodology.

**H2 Objectives**: Ship v1 platform, onboard 10 customers, close $2M seed round,
prepare for growth phase.

**Core Product Bet**: Automated reliability loop - developers upload samples, we
auto-generate graders, integrate seamlessly, continuously evaluate, and optimize
prompts automatically.

# 2. Strategy Overview

## Mission & Vision

**Bolt Foundry is building the operating system for LLMs**. We're transforming
Large Language Model development from unreliable, ad-hoc prompt engineering into
structured, engineering-rigorous systems that achieve 99% reliability.

We solve the four critical problems plaguing today's LLM development:

- **Unreliable systems**: One prompt change breaks unrelated functionality
- **Unmaintainable code**: No structure, reusability, or clear interfaces
- **Untestable components**: Can't verify individual pieces work correctly
- **Scaling challenges**: Each new use case starts from scratch

## Where We Are Now vs. Where We Want to Go

### Current State (H1 2024)

- **Alpha phase product** (v0.1-0.5) with core CLI tools and SDK
- **Developer tools foundation**: aibff CLI, structured prompt building APIs
- **Open source approach** with growing developer interest
- **Five-person team** in alpha phase
- **Early validation** of our cards/decks/graders methodology
- **Two paying customers** at $1k/month each with active pipeline of demo
  meetings

### Target State (End of H2 2024)

- **Production-ready v1 platform** with web GUI and full feature set
- **Functioning marketing engine** that consistently generates qualified leads
  and converts customers
- **$2M seed funding** secured to accelerate growth and team expansion
- **Fully scaled operations** ready to handle rapid customer growth beyond
  initial 10 customers
- **Market positioning** as the go-to infrastructure for reliable LLM
  development

# 3. Key Objectives

## Company-level OKRs for H2

  production infrastructure deployed, documentation finalized
- **Onboard 10 customers to validate product-market fit** - 10 active customers
  with â‰¥8/10 satisfaction and established feedback loop
- **Complete seed funding round** - Close $2M round with strategic investors and
  finalized board composition
- **Prepare for next phase** - Define growth strategy, team expansion plan, and
  v2 roadmap based on customer feedback

## Success Metrics

- **Primary (Q3):** v1 shipped, 10 customers onboarded, seed round closed
- **Q4:** Scale the product and keep shipping product
- **Secondary:** Customer retention >90%, product usage metrics trending up
- **Leading Indicators:** Demo conversion rate [TBD%], customer engagement
  scores [TBD threshold], feature adoption rates [TBD%]

# 5. Product & Engineering Plans

## Core Product Vision: Automated Reliability Loop

Our primary product bet is a simple integration that automatically improves LLM
reliability:

1. **Sample Upload Interface**: Users upload LLM output examples
2. **Auto-Generated Multi-Dimensional Graders**: System creates graders across
   quality dimensions
3. **Stack Integration**: Seamless integration into existing LLM pipelines
4. **Continuous Evaluation**: Real-time grading of new samples
5. **Automatic Prompt Optimization**: Grades feed back to improve prompts
   automatically

**Key Hypothesis**: This will be simple and high-return enough to be a "no
brainer" for developers needing reliability.

## Development Priorities

- **Multi-Dimensional Grader Generation**: Expand from single-dimension (Munch
  beta) to automatic multi-dimensional grading
- **Seamless Stack Integration**: Drop-in SDK/API for major LLM providers and
  frameworks
- **Installation & Onboarding**: Frictionless setup, potentially via AI coding
  assistant integration
- **Real-Time Feedback Loop**: Streaming pipeline for sub-second evaluation and
  prompt updates

**Owner**: Randall

## Key Risks

**Technical**: Grader quality, integration complexity, performance scaling
**Product**: Adoption friction, value demonstration, competitive pressure

# 6. Go-to-Market & Growth Initiatives

## Messaging & Positioning Strategy

### Target Customer Personas

#### Primary: AI-First Startup CTOs/Eng Leaders

- **Profile**: Technical leaders at AI startups building LLM-powered products
- **Pain Points**: Reliability issues causing customer churn, inability to scale
  AI features confidently
- **Message**: "Ship AI features with confidence. Get the reliability
  infrastructure you need to scale."

#### Secondary: Enterprise AI Teams

- **Profile**: ML/AI teams at larger companies implementing LLM solutions
- **Pain Points**: Need to meet enterprise reliability standards, compliance
  requirements
- **Message**: "Meet enterprise reliability standards for AI. 99% uptime
  requires 99% AI reliability."

### Key Messaging Pillars

#### 1. Reliability Crisis Recognition

_"90% accurate AI feels broken to users. The companies that achieve 99%
reliability will dominate their markets."_

#### 2. Infrastructure Necessity

_"You wouldn't deploy code without testing frameworks. Why deploy AI without
reliability frameworks?"_

#### 3. Developer Experience

_"From prompt hacking to prompt engineering. Build AI systems the way you build
software - with structure, testing, and confidence."_

#### 4. Competitive Advantage

_"While others accept 'good enough' AI, you'll ship AI that actually works.
Every time."_

# 8. Team & Ops

## Current Team (5 people)

- **Engineering**: Randall (Lead), Justin (Frontend/Backend)
- **Business/Growth**: Dan (CEO), Josh (BD/Sales)
- **Operations**: Mofe (Ops)

## H2 Approach: Stay Lean

- No full-time hiring planned - current team sufficient for v1 and 10 customers
- Potential part-time contractors: marketing (content/demand gen) and product
  design (UI/UX)
- Focus: Engineering 100% on v1, Business on customers and fundraising
- Maintain cost efficiency while scaling

# 9. Risks & Dependencies

## Major Risks

**Execution Risk**: Can we build and ship fast enough before running out of
money? _Mitigation_: Ruthless feature prioritization, parallel development,
weekly milestones, early customer beta testing.

**Competitive Risk**: Can we stay ahead of well-funded competitors and existing
platforms expanding into our space? _Mitigation_: Focus on superior developer
experience, rapid customer-driven iteration, thought leadership.

## Key Dependencies

- **Technical**: RLHF algorithm performance, multi-model compatibility,
  evaluation pipeline scalability
- **Business**: Demo-to-customer conversion rates, seed round timeline,
  sustained market demand for AI reliability
- **External**: LLM provider API stability, regulatory environment, economic
  climate for startup funding
