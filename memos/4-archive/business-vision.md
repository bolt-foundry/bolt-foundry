# Bolt Foundry business vision

## Revenue model

We will charge a monthly subscription fee for credits that expire each month.
This credit-based system enables usage-based pricing while providing predictable
revenue through our core **customer feedback → evaluation specs → improved AI
responses** workflow:

- **Feedback Processing**: Each customer feedback interaction processed through
  our RLHF workflow consumes credits
- **Evaluation Specs**: Automated generation of evaluation specifications from
  customer feedback patterns and satisfaction metrics
- **Response Optimization**: Continuous improvement of AI responses based on
  customer success outcomes and feedback analysis
- **Performance Analytics**: Customer satisfaction tracking, response quality
  analysis, and success optimization services

This model follows successful precedents like [Replit](https://replit.com),
allowing us to charge based on value delivered while giving flexibility in
credit allocation for different customer types and feedback volumes.

## Go-to-market strategy

### Primary: customer-focused growth through contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration

Our core strategy leverages our team's content creation background to focus on
customer transformations and collaborative success stories:

- **Customer Transformation Content**: Blog posts and case studies showcasing
  the contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration user journey
- **Thought Leadership**: Podcasts, speaking engagements, and industry
  discussions about customer-centric AI development and collaborative workflows
- **Customer Success Community**: Building relationships with companies seeking
  to improve their AI systems through customer feedback integration and team
  collaboration
- **Collaborative Success Stories**: Demonstrating measurable improvements in
  customer satisfaction, team productivity, and business outcomes through our
  platform

### Distribution channels

**Customer Success + Freemium Model:**

- Basic contexteng.ai discovery and demo experience available free
- Customer satisfaction tracking and basic collaboration features provided free
- Advanced features (enterprise collaboration workflows, custom evaluation
  specs, advanced customer success analytics) monetized
- Natural progression from individual contexteng.ai trials to team collaboration
  to enterprise-wide customer success optimization

This aligns with our "Gradual Adoption" principle from our
[company vision](./company-vision.md), allowing companies to experience the
contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration journey before committing to paid services.

## Customer acquisition funnel

Our acquisition follows the **contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration** user
journey:

1. **Awareness**: Content marketing and thought leadership establish our
   customer transformation expertise through contexteng.ai → demo →
   collaboration stories
2. **Trial**: Companies discover contexteng.ai and experience the demo process
   to understand customer-focused AI development
3. **Value Realization**: Basic collaboration workflow demonstrates improved
   customer satisfaction, team productivity, and business outcomes
4. **Conversion**: Teams need advanced collaboration features, customer success
   analytics, or custom evaluation frameworks
5. **Expansion**: Enterprise customers require enhanced security, support, and
   custom collaboration integrations

## Market strategy

### Early stage: customer transformation through collaboration

Focus on companies with existing AI systems experiencing customer satisfaction
and team collaboration issues. Provide immediate value through the
**contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration** journey, showing measurable
improvements in customer outcomes.

### Growth stage: enterprise collaboration platforms

Expand to larger organizations needing comprehensive customer feedback
integration, advanced collaboration analytics, and custom evaluation frameworks.
Scale the core workflow with enterprise-grade team collaboration and customer
success tracking.

### Mature stage: industry-standard customer-focused AI infrastructure

Become the standard for AI systems requiring continuous improvement through
customer feedback, with our **contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration** workflow as
the industry norm for enterprise-grade collaborative AI development systems.

## Competitive positioning

Unlike existing solutions ([LangChain](https://langchain.com),
[DSPy](https://dspy-docs.vercel.app)) that focus on technical implementation, we
provide customer-centric improvement workflows similar to how
[Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) revolutionized CRM. Our structured approach
to customer feedback integration is unique in the market.

We compete on:

- **Customer focus**: Direct connection between customer feedback and AI
  improvement through contexteng.ai → demo → collaboration journey
- **Measurable outcomes**: Clear customer satisfaction metrics and collaborative
  success tracking
- **Business impact**: ROI through improved customer experiences and team
  productivity, not just technical metrics
- **Workflow integration**: Seamless collaborative processes that fit existing
  customer success operations and team workflows

## Financial philosophy

We prefer bootstrapping toward ramen profitability over raising large amounts of
capital. This approach:

- Maintains focus on customer value over growth metrics
- Preserves optionality for future funding or strategic decisions
- Aligns with our team's preference for sustainable, collaborative work
- Forces discipline around product-market fit before scaling

We're open to funding if it accelerates our mission to help people build better
LLM applications, but not dependent on it for survival.

| **Big Tech Competition**                  | Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google building similar customer success tools and bundling them with LLM services                                   | Position as "Switzerland of LLM providers" - vendor-neutral customer success tooling that helps companies avoid lock-in. Platform bundling creates counter-demand for independent solutions. Leverage focused team composition to outbuild typical big company efforts (10-vs-5 dynamic, not 200-vs-5).                                                  |
| **Incumbent Ecosystem Entrenchment**      | Existing customer success tools and manual feedback processes having deep organizational penetration, making adoption difficult despite superior outcomes | Focus on early adopters who love improved customer outcomes, then expand outward ([demand shaped like a well](https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html)). Make our customer success workflow "as easy to use as not use" so our baseline becomes the new "good enough." Address our market positioning through direct customer success team development. |
| **Wrong Abstraction Level**               | Building too high-level (companies want control) or wrong dimension entirely (focusing on technical metrics when real pain is customer satisfaction)      | Direct customer development with customer success teams experiencing active pain points. Follow complaint patterns in customer success communities to validate workflow choices early.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Minimum Viable Revenue Identification** | With limited runway, must quickly identify which features customer success teams will pay for immediately vs. find intellectually interesting             | Focus validation on customer satisfaction tracking, automated feedback processing, and advanced RLHF workflows as leading candidates. Use direct customer development and following customer success pain points for rapid validation.                                                                                                                   |
| **Revenue Generation Timeline**           | Converting interest to paid customers fast enough to extend runway while operating with minimal resources                                                 | Balance speed-to-revenue with product quality sufficient to retain early customers and build word-of-mouth growth. Target individual developers for faster sales cycles.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Resource Allocation Under Constraints** | Staying lean while potentially lacking expertise in customer success tooling, requiring focus without capability gaps                                     | Run fast, cheap, and build great things people really need. Focus entirely on core customer feedback-to-AI improvement value proposition without getting distracted by adjacent opportunities.                                                                                                                                                           |

## Long-term vision

We see multiple paths to success:

- **Large Company**: Becoming the "Salesforce for AI Customer Success" - the
  standard platform for customer-driven AI improvement through collaborative
  workflows
- **Major Open Source Project**: Driving industry standards for customer-focused
  AI development while monetizing enterprise collaboration services
- **Strategic Acquisition**: Providing core customer success and collaboration
  infrastructure for larger AI platforms

Our priority is building something important that helps companies create AI
systems that truly serve their customers better, regardless of the specific
business outcome.
