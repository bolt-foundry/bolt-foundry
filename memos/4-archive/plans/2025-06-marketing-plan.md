# 30-day content marketing tactical plan

## What are we building?

A content marketing operation that consistently produces valuable content for
developers struggling with prompt reliability. We're launching two content
streams: an evergreen docs section that establishes our worldview on structured
prompts, and a weekly podcast where we fix prompts and build assistants live.

This creates our first marketing muscle. We're moving from having great strategy
docs to reaching developers with helpful content they can use immediately.

## Why do we need to build it?

Right now we have solid strategic foundation but zero marketing operations.
Developers experiencing prompt reliability issues don't know we exist or how we
can help them. We need to start creating and distributing valuable content
consistently.

The three-person team has strong writing and media production backgrounds, so we
can create high-quality content efficiently. The podcast-first approach lets us
generate authentic conversation-driven content that naturally multiplies into
blog posts and documentation.

## Goals

| Goal                      | Description                                                    | Success Criteria                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Existing assets

- Clear brand voice and messaging framework (`decks/cards/brand-voice.card.md`)
- Comprehensive strategic positioning (business-vision.md, product-plan.md)
- Technical philosophy and worldview (improving-inference-philosophy.md,
  card-system.md)
- Strong technical expertise and domain authority

### Content gaps to fill

- **Evergreen docs section**: Worldview/philosophy content for website
- **Regular news/updates**: Blog-style content showing momentum and engagement
- **Podcast content**: Live problem-solving and assistant building

## Anti-goals

| Anti-Goal                    | Reason                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perfect content optimization | We need to establish the habit first, optimize later          |
| SEO-driven content strategy  | Good content attracts audience organically, SEO is downstream |
| Complex content workflows    | Keep it simple enough for 2 part-time people to execute       |

## Technical approach

Start with the simplest possible execution: weekly podcast conversations that
naturally generate written content. Use existing strategic docs as foundation
for evergreen content. Focus on consistency over perfection.

The podcast format removes the pressure of perfect written content while
showcasing our expertise through live problem-solving. This authentic approach
aligns with our brand voice of casual directness.
