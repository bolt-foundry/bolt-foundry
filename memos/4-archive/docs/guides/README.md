# Bolt Foundry Documentation

Welcome to the Bolt Foundry documentation! Bolt Foundry is a Customer Success
Platform for AI that enables continuous improvement through customer feedback
using RLHF workflows.

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md) - Quick introduction to Bolt
  Foundry
- [Deck System Guide](./deck-system.md) - Learn about behavior specifications
  and evaluation
- [Telemetry API Reference](./telemetry-api.md) - Track and analyze AI model
  performance

## Key Concepts

### What is Bolt Foundry?

Bolt Foundry helps you:

- **Collect** real-world feedback from your AI applications
- **Evaluate** AI responses against behavior specifications
- **Improve** models through RLHF workflows based on actual usage

### Core Components

1. **Decks & Cards**: Modular behavior specifications that define how your AI
   should behave
2. **Evaluations**: Automated grading of AI responses against specifications
3. **Telemetry**: Real-time tracking of model performance and user interactions
4. **RLHF Workflows**: Continuous improvement loops based on customer feedback
