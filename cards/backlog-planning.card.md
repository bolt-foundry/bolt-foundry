# Backlog Planning

The backlog is a simple parking lot for ideas - a place to capture semi-formed
thoughts for future consideration without committing to them.

## Purpose

A backlog serves as a tickler file where ideas can be:

- Captured quickly without overthinking
- Stored for future reference
- Pulled organically when they become relevant

## Structure

Keep it flat and simple:

| Feature        | Description        |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| [Feature name] | [What it would do] |

That's it. No priorities, no categories, no dates.

## Best Practices

### Do:

- Add ideas as they come up
- Keep descriptions brief but clear
- Ask AI to add items (helps avoid duplicates)
- Pull items organically when they become relevant
- Keep the format consistent

### Don't:

- Overthink whether something belongs
- Add complex categorization
- Prioritize prematurely
- Feel obligated to work through items systematically
- Add items manually if AI is available

## When to Use

Add to backlog when:

- An idea is worth remembering but not urgent
- You want to capture a thought without disrupting current work
- Someone suggests a feature that might be useful someday

Work on something immediately when:

- It's small and relevant to current work
- It blocks current progress
- The context is fresh and implementation is obvious

Trust your judgment on which path to take.

## Maintenance

The backlog doesn't need regular grooming or review. Items naturally become
relevant or obsolete over time. If something sits in the backlog forever, that's
fine - it's serving its purpose as a memory aid.
