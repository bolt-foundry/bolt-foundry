# Strategy Memo: Strategic Planning Protocol

A strategy memo is designed to help everyone know what's going on and be on the
same page. When developing strategic plans, follow these guidelines:

## Start With Purpose (Not Activities)

- Define clear, compelling organizational purpose

## Define Opportunities (Not Just Challenges)

- State the strategic opportunity in clear, simple terms

## Measure What Matters (Not What's Easy)

- Define how strategic success will be evaluated
- Set up measurable indicators tied to value creation
- Plan for systematic market feedback
- Include metrics showing long-term impact
- Remember: "Strategy drives execution, not the reverse"

## Communicate Clearly (Skip the Buzzwords)

- Use direct, precise language - no jargon
- Create purpose-centered plans that inspire action
- Develop ways to cascade strategy throughout the organization

## Make It Tangible

- Use strategic frameworks with concrete examples
- Include relevant market data and insights
- Organize from vision and purpose to specific actions
- Avoid abstract concepts without practical implications

The strategy memo should enable aligned decision-making and focused execution,
prioritizing market opportunities that create sustainable value. It should
reflect the belief that "Strategic clarity creates confidence" and that
disciplined focus beats scattered initiatives. A well-understood strategy that
drives consistent action is better than a perfect strategy that sits on a shelf.
When in doubt, simplify and focus on what truly matters.

Note: Strategy development should follow an iterative approach with clear
versions (1.0 for foundational strategy, 1.1 for refinements, 2.0 for major
strategic shifts, etc.) to track evolution and ensure continued relevance.
