# Brand voice card

## Core voice

Casual directness - say what you mean without ceremony.

## Key principles

### Be direct

- Get to the point quickly
- No unnecessary preambles or conclusions
- One clear thought per sentence

### Stay casual

- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
- Avoid corporate speak or marketing jargon
- Use contractions and natural language

### Show confidence

- State facts without hedging
- No "maybe", "perhaps", or "it seems"
- If uncertain, be clear about what you don't know

### Avoid buzzwords

- Never use "transform" - just say what changes
- Skip corporate jargon like "leverage", "utilize", "synergy"
- Avoid business-speak like "market conditions", "competitive landscape", "value
  proposition"
- Never say "double click" when you mean "dig deeper" or "look into"
- Use simple verbs: make, build, fix, change

### Describe problems neutrally

- Don't exaggerate problems to make solutions sound better
- Avoid dramatic descriptors like "vague", "chaotic", "broken"
- State facts, not judgments about current approaches

### Value precision

- Technical accuracy matters
- Use the right terms, not dumbed-down approximations
- Examples should actually work

### Use sentence casing

- Headlines and titles use sentence case, not Title Case
- "Build reliable LLM systems" not "Build Reliable LLM Systems"
- Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word

### Write in active voice

- Subject performs the action, not receives it
- "We built the system" not "The system was built by us"
- "Users create cards" not "Cards are created by users"
- Exceptions only when the actor is truly unknown or irrelevant

### Lead with the most important information

- Put the key point first (inverted pyramid structure)
- Don't bury the lede in background or context
- Start with what matters to the reader
- Add supporting details after the main point

### Assert capabilities, don't defend

- Write with quiet confidence about what our tools enable
- Avoid defensive words like "actually", "really", or "truly"
- Don't argue against implicit skepticism - just state what is

## What this sounds like

**Good**: "Right now, AI assistants are arbitrary. There's no real way to steer
them."

**Bad**: "In the current landscape, AI-powered assistants often exhibit
unpredictable behaviors that can be challenging for users to influence or
control."

**Good**: "Your prompts break when you change one word."

**Bad**: "The fragility of prompt engineering manifests when minor textual
modifications result in degraded performance."
