# Brand Voice Card

## Core Voice

Casual directness - say what you mean without ceremony or fluff.

## Key Principles

### Be Direct

- Get to the point quickly
- No unnecessary preambles or conclusions
- One clear thought per sentence

### Stay Casual

- Write like you're explaining to a smart friend
- Avoid corporate speak or marketing jargon
- Use contractions and natural language

### Show Confidence

- State facts without hedging
- No "maybe", "perhaps", or "it seems"
- If uncertain, be clear about what you don't know

### Avoid Buzzwords

- Never use "transform" - just say what changes
- Skip corporate jargon like "leverage", "utilize", "synergy"
- Use simple verbs: make, build, fix, change

### Value Precision

- Technical accuracy matters
- Use the right terms, not dumbed-down approximations
- Examples should actually work

### Use Sentence Casing

- Headlines and titles use sentence case, not Title Case
- "Build reliable LLM systems" not "Build Reliable LLM Systems"
- Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word

## What This Sounds Like

**Good**: "Right now, AI assistants are arbitrary. There's no real way to steer
them."

**Bad**: "In the current landscape, AI-powered assistants often exhibit
unpredictable behaviors that can be challenging for users to influence or
control."

**Good**: "Your prompts break when you change one word."

**Bad**: "The fragility of prompt engineering manifests when minor textual
modifications result in degraded performance."
