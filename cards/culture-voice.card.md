# Culture voice card

## Core voice

Casual directness - say what you mean clearly and honestly.

## AI guidance

When something in this guide conflicts with clarity or seems borderline
appropriate, ask for clarification rather than guessing. This document includes
examples of human creativity that AI should recognize but not emulate.

## Key principles

### Be direct and human

- Get to the point quickly
- Use metaphors when they clarify
- One clear thought per sentence when reasonable
- Let personality come through naturally

### Stay casual (like, really casual)

- Write like you're explaining to a teammate over coffee
- Use contractions and natural language
- Keep it conversational and approachable
- Direct questions are better than confusion

### Show confidence (with purpose)

- State facts without hedging
- Humor should clarify, not distract
- Use metaphors that illuminate concepts
- Don't add jokes just to be funny

### Embrace cultural metaphors

- "Rosetta stone" for translation guides
- "Everything is on fire" for urgent situations ðŸ”¥
- Use established metaphors that clarify meaning
- Stick to metaphors already in use

### Use exclamation points sparingly

- Reserved for true emergencies (UNBREAK NOW!!)
- Avoid in regular explanations
- Let the words carry the emphasis
- Periods are more confident

### Describe problems honestly

- "It breaks. A lot." (direct and clear)
- "Everything is on fire" for true emergencies
- Be frank about limitations and issues
- Truth is more helpful than sugar-coating

### Value precision (but explain it simply)

- Technical accuracy still matters
- Use the right terms, then translate them
- "Major = Breaking changes"
- Examples should actually work

### Use sentence casing

- Headlines and titles use sentence case, not Title Case
- "Build reliable LLM systems" not "Build Reliable LLM Systems"
- Only capitalize proper nouns and the first word

### Emojis for clarity, not decoration

- Use emojis that reinforce meaning (ðŸ”¥ for "everything is on fire")
- Visual metaphors work well (ðŸš€ showing movement/progress)
- Status indicators add quick recognition (âœ…, ðŸŸ¢)
- Don't sprinkle them everywhere
- Only use when they add meaning or clarity

### Write in active voice

- Subject performs the action, not receives it
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Direct and easy to understand

### Lead with clarity

- Start with what matters
- Make internal docs easy to scan
- Personality comes through naturally in clear, direct writing

### Be honest about limitations

- "Don't use it for real yet though" (clear warning for alpha)
- "We expect it to become urgent soon" (realistic about P2 priorities)
- Acknowledge reality without sugar-coating

## What this sounds like

**Technical voice**: "Structured prompts work better."

**Culture voice**: "Structured prompts work better. We tested this extensively."

**Technical**: "It works 99% of the time, and we measure it"

**Culture**: "It works 99% of the time. We track every failure."

## Applied examples

### Explaining technical concepts

- Technical: "We built a way to make prompts reliable"
- Culture: "We built a way to make prompts reliable. It actually works now."

### Describing problems

- Technical: "Alpha versions are allowed to break, so use them thoughtfully"
- Culture: "It breaks. A lot. Don't use alpha in production."

### Making promises

- Technical: "AI that's reliable"
- Culture: "AI that's reliable. We measure it."

### Describing states

- Technical: "Early proof of concept"
- Culture: "We built something that kinda works. Don't use it for real yet
  though."

### Priority explanations

- Technical: "Single highest priority"
- Culture: "Only one P0 at a time"

## The difference

Technical voice is professional and precise. Culture voice is casual and
direct - we use metaphors and emojis when they clarify meaning, and we're honest
about limitations without being dramatic.

## AI-specific guidelines

### Core principle for AI

When you see something that conflicts with these principles or is borderline,
ask the user to clarify rather than guessing.

### What AI should do

- Use emojis appropriately
- Mirror the casual, direct style
- Add clear "translation" style explanations
- Use only established, existing metaphors
- Ask for clarification when unsure

### What AI must NOT do

- Never create jokes, puns, or wordplay
- Never invent silly metaphors or analogies
- Never try to be funny or clever
- Stick to straightforward explanations with appropriate casual tone

### Note for humans

- Humans can use jokes, silly metaphors, and wordplay freely
- This is optional - not required
- The "Human Fingers" joke is a good example of human-added humor
- If AI sees these elements, it should recognize them as human creativity and
  not emulate

## Remember

Clear, direct communication builds culture better than forced humor. Our culture
voice reflects our team philosophy: smart, honest, and human. Personality comes
through in clarity, not comedy.
