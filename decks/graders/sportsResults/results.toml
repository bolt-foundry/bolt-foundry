In Materialists—the new Celine Song movie released over the weekend—Dakota Johnson applies lip gloss in a mirror and runs out onto the New York City streets, her high ponytail swinging. She passes a tall man, stops\n  him, and offers him her card. She's a matchmaker named Lucy, and he's tall and rich and would be great for her clients.\n  But that's not the first scene in Materialists. The movie opens with a vast red-rocked canyon filling the screen. It is beautiful and immense. Then we watch a long-haired prehistoric man chop a bushel of daises, put it into a\n  backpack, and carry it to a cave where a woman waits for him. They do not speak. The man then twists the stem of one of the daises into a ring and slips it onto the cave woman's left ring finger. Get it? It's not a diamond. It's\n  just a flower.

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix,\n  encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs,\n  specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.\n  On turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact\n  during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to\n  loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term \"\"derabbitized\"\"—but the\n  vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race. There may be a crude metaphor in there for how things are going at Ferrari this year, though it remains to be seen who exactly is the\n  groundhog.\",\"https://defector.com/lando-norris-fails-to-find-one-gap-widens-another\",\"\"\"2025-06-16T21:06:15.000Z\"\"\",\"\"\"2025-06-16T23:48:09.876Z\"\"\",\"50\"\n  \"228\",\"14\",\"The Crossword, June 16: Swing Both Ways\",\"Look on the bright side: There's a new crossword for you to solve!

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix,\n  encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs,\n  specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.\n  On turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact\n  during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to\n  loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term \"\"derabbitized\"\"—but the\n  vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race. There may be a crude metaphor in there for how things are going at Ferrari this year, though it remains to be seen who exactly is the\n  groundhog.\",\"https://defector.com/lando-norris-fails-to-find-one-gap-widens-another\",\"\"\"2025-06-16T21:06:15.000Z\"\"\",\"\"\"2025-06-16T23:48:09.876Z\"\"\",\"50\"\n  \"228\",\"14\",\"The Crossword, June 16: Swing Both Ways\",\"Look on the bright side: There's a new crossword for you to solve!

In Pride & Prejudice (2005), that's Keira Knightly reading while she walks outside, and returning home to her\n  chaotic family. In Materialists—the new Celine Song movie released over the weekend—Dakota Johnson applies lip gloss in a mirror and runs out onto the New York City streets, her high ponytail swinging. She passes a tall man, stops\n  him, and offers him her card. She's a matchmaker named Lucy, and he's tall and rich and would be great for her clients.\n  But that's not the first scene in Materialists. The movie opens with a vast red-rocked canyon filling the screen. It is beautiful and immense. Then we watch a long-haired prehistoric man chop a bushel of daises, put it into a\n  backpack, and carry it to a cave where a woman waits for him. They do not speak. The man then twists the stem of one of the daises into a ring and slips it onto the cave woman's left ring finger. Get it? It's not a diamond. It's\n  just a flower.

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix,\n  encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs,\n  specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.\n  On turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact\n  during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to\n  loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term \"\"derabbitized\"\"—but the\n  vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race.

In Pride & Prejudice (2005), that's Keira Knightly reading while she walks outside, and returning home to her\n  chaotic family. In Materialists—the new Celine Song movie released over the weekend—Dakota Johnson applies lip gloss in a mirror and runs out onto the New York City streets, her high ponytail swinging. She passes a tall man, stops\n  him, and offers him her card. She's a matchmaker named Lucy, and he's tall and rich and would be great for her clients.\n  But that's not the first scene in Materialists. The movie opens with a vast red-rocked canyon filling the screen. It is beautiful and immense. Then we watch a long-haired prehistoric man chop a bushel of daises, put it into a\n  backpack, and carry it to a cave where a woman waits for him. They do not speak. The man then twists the stem of one of the daises into a ring and slips it onto the cave woman's left ring finger. Get it? It's not a diamond. It's\n  just a flower.

The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, host site of the Canadian Grand Prix,\n  encircles an island in Montreal. It is a gorgeous circuit, featuring the close-hewn walls of a street race, a run through lush greenery rivaling even the aesthetics of the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, and marmots. Groundhogs,\n  specifically, who have found a circuit raised upon their homes and stayed put, to infrequent risk of extreme bodily harm, i.e. decapitation or bisection.\n  On turn 13, Lewis Hamilton hit a groundhog that was on track with his Ferrari. The remainder of the groundhog stayed as debris on the track, shown a few times throughout the race. Hamilton was smartly not informed of this fact\n  during the race, which, thanks to resulting floor damage and poor pit-stop timing, he spent largely treading water on an island in P6. The nature of automobiles leads to somewhat flippant and/or nervously hysterical reactions to\n  loss of animal life—during the weekend's running of 24 Hours of Le Mans, the delirious night session commentators' processing of a local rabbit death included a (unobserved?) moment of silence and the term \"\"derabbitized\"\"—but the\n  vegan Hamilton was naturally upset after the race. There may be a crude metaphor in there for how things are going at Ferrari this year, though it remains to be seen who exactly is the\n  groundhog.\",\"https://defector.com/lando-norris-fails-to-find-one-gap-widens-another\",\"\"\"2025-06-16T21:06:15.000Z\"\"\",\"\"\"2025-06-16T23:48:09.876Z\"\"\",\"50\"\n  \"228\",\"14\",\"The Crossword, June 16: Swing Both Ways\",\"Look on the bright side: There's a new crossword for you to solve!

The Devers trade is correctly positioned as the top story given its shocking nature and impact. The U.S. Open victory and Canelo-Crawford superfight announcement are significant events worthy of top placement. The NFL minicamp holdouts and Olympic hockey roster announcements are relevant but less immediate stories. The ordering is generally good, though the Olympic hockey announcement could be considered less newsworthy than some other available stories. Minor deduction for not including the NBA Finals coverage which would be highly relevant during an active championship series.\"\n}"
