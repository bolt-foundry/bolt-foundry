The 6-foot-4 signal-caller threw for 3,485 yards and 28 touchdowns this season while leading the Bulldogs to an 11-1 regular season record. Beck's decision comes after extensive consultation with NFL personnel who still project him as a potential first-round selection despite the injury. Medical evaluations indicate he should be fully recovered by training camp. 'After careful consideration with my family and coaches, I believe this is the right time to pursue my NFL dreams,' Beck said in a statement posted to social media. The Bulldogs will now turn to freshman phenom Gunner Stockton, who performed admirably in relief during the SEC title game.\n\nPublished: 2025-01-15T14:30:00Z\n}", "assistantResponse": "Georgia QB Carson Beck declares for 2025 NFL Draft despite torn ACL in SEC Championship game.", "score": 1}

Negotiations that began early last week broke down Sunday evening when the Milwaukee Bucks' asking price proved insurmountable. The Nets had assembled an aggressive package including Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, four first-round picks, and three pick swaps, but Milwaukee insisted on including guard Cam Thomas in any potential deal. 'At the end of the day, we believe in this roster and Giannis is the cornerstone of our championship aspirations,' Bucks GM Jon Horst said in a brief statement. The Greek Freak, who has two years remaining on his contract, averaged 31.5 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 6.4 assists this season. With the trade deadline now passed, both teams will pivot to their current rosters for the playoff push.\n\nPublished: 2025-02-08T22:15:00Z\n}", "assistantResponse": "Nets' trade pursuit of Giannis Antetokounmpo falls through; two-time MVP remains with Bucks.", "score": 3}

Hunter, selected third overall by the Tennessee Titans, is reportedly at an impasse over offset language in his four-year deal projected to be worth $38.5 million fully guaranteed.

'These negotiations always intensify as camp approaches, but we're confident deals will be completed soon,' said an NFL source familiar with the negotiations. The sticking points typically involve payment schedules, workout bonuses, and offset language that would reduce guaranteed money if a player is cut and signs elsewhere.

Playing in front of 65,000 fans at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Inter Miami became the first MLS club to win a Club World Cup match in the tournament's new 32-team format. 'This is a historic moment for our club and MLS,' said Inter Miami coach Tata Martino. 'But we're not satisfied with just participating - we want to show the world that MLS can compete with anyone.'

The Thunder now lead the series 2-0 and are two wins away from their first championship since relocating from Seattle. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the barrage with 38 points on 7-of-11 from beyond the arc, while Chet Holmgren added 24 points and 12 rebounds. The Thunder shot an incredible 22-of-38 (57.9%) from three-point range, breaking the previous Finals record of 20 set by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2017.

Answering one big question for seven QBs entering Year 2\n\nContent: As Michael Penix Jr. enters his second NFL season, questions remain about his development trajectory. After just three starts in his rookie campaign, Penix showed flashes of the arm talent that made him a first-round pick, but also displayed concerning tendencies. His aggressive downfield approach often led to forcing throws into tight coverage, and his habit of locking onto his primary receiver resulted in missed opportunities elsewhere on the field. While Penix has 'all the tools,' analysts note he needs 'some sharpening' - particularly in processing full-field reads and keeping the offense on schedule. The limited sample size makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about his career arc.\n\nPublished: 2025-06-10T11:00:00Z\n}", "assistantResponse": "Michael Penix Jr. shows promise but needs work on reads and decision-making entering Year 2.", "score": -3}
