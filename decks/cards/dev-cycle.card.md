# Development Cycle

We run a simple two-week cycle with retros and kickoffs to keep everyone
aligned.

## Cycle Structure

**Every two weeks:**

- **Friday**: Retro (look back, discuss what went well/poorly, plan ahead)
- **Monday**: Kickoff (check in, ensure everyone knows what to work on)

**Daily touchpoints:**

- **9:30 AM EST**: East coast standup
- **9:30 AM MT**: Mountain time standup

**Weekly fun:**

- **Friday 4 PM EST**: Game central

## Meeting Focus

### Friday Retro

- Review what was accomplished
- Discuss what went well
- Identify what could improve
- Look ahead to next cycle

### Monday Kickoff

- Quick alignment check
- Ensure everyone knows their focus
- No heavy planning needed

## Flexibility

- Cycle adjusts for holidays
- No rigid documentation requirements
- Focus on conversation over artifacts

## Best Practices

### Do:

- Keep meetings focused and brief
- Adjust cycle for team availability
- Use standups for daily coordination
- Make time for team building (game central)

### Don't:

- Create heavy process documentation
- Stick rigidly to schedule during holidays
- Skip retros or kickoffs
- Make meetings longer than needed

The goal is sustainable rhythm with regular touchpoints, not rigid process.
