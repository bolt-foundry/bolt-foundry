Title: Georgia QB Carson Beck Declares for NFL Draft Despite Season-Ending Injury

Content: Georgia quarterback Carson Beck announced Monday he will forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2025 NFL Draft, despite suffering a torn ACL in the SEC Championship game that ended his collegiate career. The 6-foot-4 signal-caller threw for 3,485 yards and 28 touchdowns this season while leading the Bulldogs to an 11-1 regular season record. Beck's decision comes after extensive consultation with NFL personnel who still project him as a potential first-round selection despite the injury. Medical evaluations indicate he should be fully recovered by training camp. 'After careful consideration with my family and coaches, I believe this is the right time to pursue my NFL dreams,' Beck said in a statement posted to social media. The Bulldogs will now turn to freshman phenom Gunner Stockton, who performed admirably in relief during the SEC title game.

Title: Nets-Bucks Trade Talks Fall Through; Giannis Stays Put in Milwaukee

Content: The Brooklyn Nets' ambitious pursuit of two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo has officially ended without a deal, according to sources close to both organizations. Negotiations that began early last week broke down Sunday evening when the Milwaukee Bucks' asking price proved insurmountable. The Nets had assembled an aggressive package including Mikal Bridges, Cameron Johnson, four first-round picks, and three pick swaps, but Milwaukee insisted on including guard Cam Thomas in any potential deal. 'At the end of the day, we believe in this roster and Giannis is the cornerstone of our championship aspirations,' Bucks GM Jon Horst said in a brief statement. The Greek Freak, who has two years remaining on his contract, averaged 31.5 points, 11.3 rebounds, and 6.4 assists this season. With the trade deadline now passed, both teams will pivot to their current rosters for the playoff push.

'These negotiations always intensify as camp approaches, but we're confident deals will be completed soon,' said an NFL source familiar with the negotiations. The sticking points typically involve payment schedules, workout bonuses, and offset language that would reduce guaranteed money if a player is cut and signs elsewhere. Last year, all first-round picks were signed by the third day of training camp.

Playing in front of 65,000 fans at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, Inter Miami became the first MLS club to win a Club World Cup match in the tournament's new 32-team format. 'This is a historic moment for our club and MLS,' said Inter Miami coach Tata Martino. 'But we're not satisfied with just participating - we want to show the world that MLS can compete with anyone.'

Title: Embiid, Jokic barely separated in new NBA MVP voter poll

Content: The 2021-22 NBA MVP race is likely going to be one of the closest in recent memory, if a new straw poll of voters is any indication. Sixers star Joel Embiid is having the best and most dominant season of his fantastic career, while Nuggets big man Nikola Jokic continues to break most basketball metrics out in Denver. The two are simply incredible.
But who is *more* incredible? Right now, as the league heads into the All-Star break, it seems Embiid has the edge - but only just. ESPN reporter Tim Bontemps regularly takes a few straw polls of writers and voters around the league throughout the regular season to gather a fairly accurate picture of the MVP race, and in the latest poll - the results of which were published Thursday - Embiid has a narrow advantage. Embiid was the only player to get a vote from all 100 voters who were polled, while Jokic appeared on 95 ballots and Giannis Antetokounmpo appeared on 97 ballots. (Anyone who left either player off their ballot, which has room for five players, is insane.) 

Bontemps' poll mirrors the NBA's voting system: first-place votes count for 10 points, second-place votes count for seven points, third-place votes count for five points, fourth-place votes count for three points, and fifth-place votes count for one point.

Here's how the votes shook out between Embiid and Jokic:

Embiid: 1st: 45 | 2nd: 38 | 3rd: 12 | 4th: 4 | 5th: 1

Jokic: 1st: 43 | 2nd: 39 | 3rd: 8 | 4th: 3 | 5th: 2
Whew boy, that is a tight race. Altogether, Embiid has a 35-point advantage over Jokic. For reference, the difference between Jokic in second and Antetokounmpo in third was 242 points.

Like I said: tight!

As someone who watches Embiid every time he plays and only catches Jokic games on occasion, it's hard to be completely unbiased here... but I think Embiid deserves the nod this time around.

The two were extremely close last season as well, but Jokic won the award because he was far more available to his team than Embiid was.

And while I've been told that Jokic's defense has improved, I still have a hard time believing it's at the same level as Embiid's looming paint presence. Meanwhile, Embiid has seriously elevated his passing game - not to Jokic's level, but in a big enough way to narrow that gap.

Title: ‘Most atrocious thing’: Bryson DeChambeau rips new golf ball rules

Content: The USGA and R&A shocked the golf world yesterday with a radical new proposal to create a shorter golf ball for professional golf. The announcement has inspired strong opinions on both sides of the issue, and now the most famous long-bomber in the game today, Bryson DeChambeau, has offered his own.

And based on his comments to a LIV Golf reporter on Tuesday, it’s clear he is strongly against the new proposal.

“I think it’s the most unimaginative, uninspiring, game-cutting thing you could do,” DeChambeau said ahead of this week’s LIV Golf event in Tucson, Ariz. “Everybody wants to see people hit it farther. That’s part of the reason why a lot of people like what I do. It’s part of the reason a lot of people don’t like what I do.”

The new golf ball proposal, which would come in the form of a Model Local Rule, would allow tournaments to choose to use golf balls that fly shorter, though these golf balls don’t exist yet and would need to be created by manufacturers.

The goal is to have a new ball that reduces driving yardage by roughly 15 yards for the longest players with the highest swing speeds. DeChambeau is the poster child for that type of golfer. He famously bulked up by nearly 50 lbs. for the 2019-2020 PGA Tour season, obliterating golf balls with swing speeds over 130 mph. The transformation made DeChambeau the longest driver on Tour and proved essential to his 2020 U.S. Open win.

After leaving the PGA Tour for LIV Golf in 2022, DeChambeau reportedly led that league in driving distance as well, with a 327.1-yard average. All of which is to say that the new golf ball rules likely will have a greater negative impact on DeChambeau and players like him, a point he made on Tuesday.

“It’s a great handicap for us guys that have worked really hard to learn how to hit it farther,” DeChambeau said. “I think it’s the most atrocious thing that you could possibly do to the game of golf. It’s not about rolling golf balls back; it’s about making golf courses more difficult.”

We still don’t know which tournaments will adopt the Model Local Rule, though it seems certain all USGA and R&A events will use the shorter ball in the future. The other majors will likely follow suit, though it’s too soon to say whether all PGA Tour events will make use of the new rule.

Then there’s the question of DeChambeau’s new tour, and whether LIV will follow along with the rest of pro golf or stand in opposition. What we do know is what Bryson’s choice would be if he were in charge.

“If you could say I’m the complete opposite times 1,000, that’s what I would be,” DeChambeau said, adding later, “I’m all about equality. I’m not about equity on this front.”

Title: 2023 MLB rule changes: Pitch clock, end of shift and more

Content: Change has come to the major leagues! We've had a full month of spring training games to see how the new rules that Major League Baseball's competition committee voted to implement last September have played out. Now, it's time to see those rules in action when it counts.

All of these rules have been in place in the minor leagues over the previous seasons, leading to wide-ranging changes in pace of play and on-field action. They include a first-ever pitch clock, the elimination of the shift, bigger bases and a limit to how many times a pitcher can disengage from the rubber.

Here's everything you need to know about the new rules, what they'll mean for the players and how the game is likely to change.

The shift

The new rule: At the time a pitch is thrown, all four infielders are required to be on the infield dirt (or infield grass) with two on each side of second base. Players will be able to move as soon as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand. Originally, infielders who began the game on one side of the field would not be allowed to switch to the other side for the entirety of the game, but that was revised to just each inning -- unless there's a mid-inning substitution. In other words, a player who starts an inning at first or second base has to remain on that side of the field for the whole inning but can switch to short or third base the next inning. If there's an injury mid-inning, then the infield can be reset.

How it will be enforced: If the hitting team reaches base and runners advance on a ball hit under the violation, the game proceeds without penalties. If the play has any other consequence -- an out, a sacrifice, etc. -- the hitting team can decide either to accept the penalty -- which would add one ball to the hitter's count -- or decline it, and the play would stand.

What they're trying to change: The leaguewide batting average was down to .243 in 2022, the lowest since 1968. A lack of singles in particular is at the heart of the decline, with 2022's rate of 5.33 per team the third lowest in MLB history -- and the 2021 and 2020 seasons filling the two spots ahead of it on the all-time list.

What it's meant in the minors: During the first two months of the 2022 minor league season, in the lower levels of the minors where shifts are regulated, the batting average on balls in play by left-handed hitters rose by eight points. At Triple-A -- where shifts are not banned -- it was up only three points.

What players are saying: It would be hard to find a hitter -- especially a left-handed one -- who isn't on board with eliminating the shift.

"Growing up, we never had that," Dodgers outfielder Joey Gallo said last season. "It's tough to adjust to it because it wasn't a thing in the minors. ... Over time, it's gotten more extreme and more effective. From a hitter's standpoint, it's something that could be changed."

Perhaps surprisingly, some pitchers are onboard with the move, as well.

"My biggest complaint about the shift is, how do you explain that to kids?" Phillies reliever David Robertson said. "What's the point of having a shortstop if he can't play shortstop?"

Pitch clock

The new rule: Pitchers will have 15 seconds to throw a pitch with the bases empty and 20 seconds with a runner on base. Hitters will need to be in the batter's box with eight seconds on the pitch clock.

How it will be enforced: If a pitcher has not started "the motion to deliver a pitch" before the expiration of the clock, he will be charged with a ball. If a batter delays entering the box, he will be charged with a strike.

Each stadium will have two clocks located behind home plate on either side of the umpire while two more will be required in the outfield on either side of the batter's eye. Spring stadiums may only have one clock in the outfield but will otherwise be fitted to the exact parameters as the MLB ones. Each umpire will be equipped with technology which will inform them when the pitch clock has expired. And for the first time, umpires will also have the ability to speak with each other via communication devices without having to meet in the middle of the infield.

What they're trying to change: The average time of a nine-inning major league game in 2022 was 3 hours, 4 minutes, which is actually a six-minute decline from 2021's all-time high -- but the time of game has been rising consistently since first crossing the three-hour mark in 2014.

While it is not directly correlated, Statcast's pitch tempo tracker shows 110 pitchers averaged at least 20 seconds per pitch with the bases empty in 2022.

What it's meant in the minors: When stricter pitch clock enforcement -- based on a 14-second clock with the bases empty and an 18-second clock with runners on -- began in the minors earlier in 2022, the results were immediate. Over the first 132 minor league games under the new rules, the average game time was 2 hours, 39 minutes. That's 20 minutes shorter than the average time of a control set of 335 games run without the clock to begin the season (2 hours, 59 minutes) and 24 minutes shorter than the average of the 2021 season (3 hours, 3 minutes average).

What players are saying: There's been mixed reactions to the pitch clock, with veteran relievers worried about rushing through high-leverage situations. But many young players who have spent time in the minors during the past couple of seasons are already used to it. In addition to the new pickoff rules, which are tied to the pitch clock, this is bound to create the most debate among players.

Pickoffs

The new rule: Pickoffs are one version of a "disengagement," which consists of any time the pitcher makes a pickoff attempt, fakes a pickoff, or simply steps off the rubber for any reason, as well as when the defense requests time. Pitchers are allowed two disengagements per plate appearance without penalty. The disengagements rule resets if a runner or runners advance a base within the same plate appearance.

How it will be enforced: After a third step-off, the pitcher will be charged with a balk, unless at least one offensive player advances a base or an out is made on the ensuing play after the step off.

What they're trying to change: A lack of action on the basepaths has been a concern of MLB's in recent attempts to improve the aesthetics of the sport, with stolen bases per team down to 0.51 per game in 2022 from 0.66 a decade ago. (In the 1980s and 1990s, stolen base rates hovered around the 0.75 range.)

What it's meant in the minors: In 2021, when the pickoff rules went into effect in Single-A and High-A, stolen base attempts skyrocketed. In 2022, as the rules expanded to every league, baseball saw big gains throughout the minors.

Bigger bases

The new rule: The size of bases will be increased from 15 inches to 18 inches.

What they're trying to change: The increase in the size of the bases should reduce injuries around them while increasing stolen base attempts.

What it's meant in the minors: In Triple-A, the first season of larger bases didn't create much of a change on its own -- but in the lower levels, bigger bases combined with rules about pickoffs saw large increases in steals per nine innings. Even combined with the disengagement rules, though, MLB doesn't believe either change will lead to teams being unable to control the run game. Injuries were reduced around the bag after the increase in the size of the bases was instituted in the minors.

Position players pitching

The new rule: Teams will be more limited in when they can pitch a position player. The previous rule allowed them to use one when up or down by six or more runs, but the sides are discussing a tweak in which the leading team would have to be up by as many as 10 or more while the trailing team would have to be down by eight or more in order to pitch a position player.

What they're trying to change: The league and now even the players agree that too many position players are taking the mound over the course of the season. In fact, players believe it's having a bigger and bigger impact on production, from offensive numbers to even defensive metrics -- all of which come into play during arbitration and free agency. In 2017, there were 32 instances of position players pitching in a game. Last season, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, that number jumped to 132.

Title: NBA All-Star Game 2023 was least-watched edition in history as ratings hit record low

Content: The ratings are in for the 2023 NBA All-Star Game, and yikes. The news isn't great.

According to figures published by Sports Media Watch, the game Sunday (which aired on both TNT and TBS) averaged a combined 2.2 rating and 4.59 million viewers. That's a significant decline from the 2022 edition of the game, which averaged a 3.1 rating (a previous record low) and 6.28 million viewers. 2023's ratings dropped 29% from 2022, and viewership dropped 27%.

That's the biggest single-season decline for the All-Star Game since 2000 (the first since the 1998-1999 lockout), according to Sports Media Watch. This year's game also drew fewer viewers than the 2022 MLB All-Star Game (7.51 million) and the NFL's new Pro Bowl Games (6.28 million).

The game itself was, well, a modern All-Star game. A number of big name stars were hurt or left early, as always happens — This year it was Steph Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Giannis Antetokounmpo. The ASG is played midseason, so no one wants to go too hard and injure themselves in a game that literally doesn't matter. When LeBron went too hard on defense in the first half, he actually hurt himself and sat out the second half.

When no one is really giving 100 percent, we get a non-competitive game like Sunday's, when Team Giannis beat Team LeBron 184-175. Nuggets head coach Michael Malone, who helmed Team LeBron, was brutally honest after the final buzzer, saying it was "the worst basketball game ever played." (Though he did credit Joel Embiid and Kyrie Irving for actually trying.)

Other events during All-Star Weekend didn't fare much better. All-Star Saturday Night produced its lowest numbers in over 20 years, averaging a 1.6 share and 3.42 million viewers on TNT, despite Mac McClung saving the Dunk Contest. That broadcast averaged a 2.0 share and 4.24 million viewers last year. The Rising Star Challenge, which aired on Friday, was down to 888,000 viewers from 2022's figure of 1.23 million.

There was an outlier in this gloomy report: the celebrity game, which actually saw an increase in viewers from 1.23 million to 1.40 million on ESPN. At least it's not all bad news, right?
