# Bolt Foundry Evals

> "The user said x. Our assistant replied y. Is that actually useful?"

## Overview

Bolt Foundry Evals helps developers create judges to test the outputs of LLMs
across multiple underlying base models.

## Features

- **Custom Judge Decks**: Create specialized judges using a standard DSL to
  easily create and update criteria and output formats.
- **Multi-Model Evaluation**: Judge responses across multiple LLMs
  simultaneously to compare performance and consistency (powered by Open Router)
- **Parallel Execution**: Run evaluations concurrently for faster results across
  multiple models and iterations
- **Meta Judge Analysis**: Calibrate and validate judge quality using ground
  truth scores to ensure consistent and accurate evaluations

## Quickstart

Set your `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
bff eval --help
```

Run evaluation with sample data:

```bash
bff eval --input packages/bolt-foundry/evals/examples/sample-data.jsonl \
         --deck packages/bolt-foundry/evals/examples/json-validator.ts
```

## Input data

Provide input data as a file in JSONL format.

```jsonl
{"userMessage": "Extract user info from: 'John Doe, 30, NYC'", "assistantResponse": "{\"name\":\"John Doe\",\"age\":30,\"city\":\"NYC\"}"}
{"userMessage": "Parse address: '123 Main St'", "assistantResponse": "{\"street\":\"123 Main St\"}"}
```

The types for the input data are:

```typescript
type Sample = {
  userMessage: string;
  assistantResponse: string;
  id?: string;
  groundTruthScore?: number; // Optional: expected score for meta-evaluation (-3 to 3)
  sampleMetadata?: Record<string, unknown>; // your custom metadata to forward along to the reporter
};

type InputSampleFile = Array<Sample>;
```

## Create your judge using judge decks

Judge decks let you build your eval logic in a structured way. Read more on our
[prompting philosophy], or the [case studies] as to why we've done it this way.

1. Structure your deck with an initial spec explaining what your judge will do.
2. Add cards to explain evaluation criteria
3. Include any variables as context, INCLUDING OUTPUT FORMAT.

To be clear, you SHOULD NOT BE INTERPOLATING ANY STRINGS IN THE SPECS. Use
`.context` builders to safely include variables. [See why].

```typescript
import { makeJudgeDeckBuilder } from "../makeJudgeDeckBuilder.ts";

// Create a judge that evaluates JSON outputs
export default makeJudgeDeckBuilder("json-validator")
  .spec(
    "You are an expert at evaluating JSON outputs for correctness and completeness.",
  )
  .card(
    "evaluation criteria",
    (c) =>
      c.spec("Check if the output is valid JSON syntax")
        .spec("Verify all required fields are present")
        .spec("Ensure data types match expected schema"),
  )
  .card(
    "scoring guidelines",
    (c) =>
      c.spec(
        "Score 3: Perfect - Strict valid JSON that exactly matches the expected schema",
      )
        .spec(
          "Score 2: Good - Valid JSON but uses relaxed syntax (single quotes, trailing commas, etc)",
        )
        .spec(
          "Score 1: Acceptable - Valid JSON but has missing optional fields",
        )
        .spec(
          "Score -1: Poor - Valid JSON but has hallucinated/extra keys not in the input",
        )
        .spec(
          "Score -3: Failure - Not JSON at all, plain text, or doesn't parse",
        ),
  );

// Note: The makeJudgeDeckBuilder automatically:
// - Appends evaluation context (userMessage, assistantResponse, expected)
// - Adds output format requirements (JSON with score and notes)
// - Handles all the boilerplate for judge evaluation
```

## Model Selection

Specify the model to use for evaluation using the `--model` flag:

```bash
bff eval --input data.jsonl --deck judge.ts --model openai/gpt-4o  # Default
bff eval --input data.jsonl --deck judge.ts --model anthropic/claude-3-opus
```

The evaluation uses OpenRouter API, so any model available on OpenRouter can be
used.

## Output Formats

Evaluations produce results that look like this:

```typescript
export interface JudgementResult {
  model: string;
  id?: string;
  iteration: number;
  score: -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3;
  latencyInMs: number;
  rawOutput: string;
  output: {
    score: number;
    notes?: string;
  };
  sampleMetadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// Example result:
{
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  id: "sample-001",
  iteration: 1,
  score: 3,
  latencyInMs: 1234,
  rawOutput: "{\"score\": 3, \"notes\": \"Perfect JSON with correct schema\"}",
  output: {
    score: 3,
    notes: "Perfect JSON with correct schema"
  },
  sampleMetadata: {
    groundTruthScore: 3  // If provided in input
  }
}
```

## Meta Judge Analysis

Bolt Foundry Evals supports "judging the judge" by comparing judge scores
against ground truth scores. This calibration feature helps you:

1. **Validate Judge Quality**: Ensure your judges score consistently and
   accurately
2. **Improve Judge Criteria**: Identify areas where judge instructions need
   refinement
3. **Compare Judge Versions**: Measure improvements when updating judge decks

### Adding Ground Truth Scores

Include a `groundTruthScore` field in your input samples:

```jsonl
{"userMessage": "Extract: name=John", "assistantResponse": "{\"name\":\"John\"}", "groundTruthScore": 3}
{"userMessage": "Parse: color=red", "assistantResponse": "{'color': 'red'}", "groundTruthScore": 2}
{"userMessage": "Convert: email=test@test.com", "assistantResponse": "test@test.com", "groundTruthScore": -3}
```

### Calibration Metrics

When ground truth scores are provided, the eval command reports:

- **Exact Match Rate**: Percentage of samples where judge score equals ground
  truth
- **Within Â±1 Accuracy**: Percentage of samples within 1 point of ground truth
- **Average Absolute Error**: Mean difference between judge and ground truth
  scores
- **Disagreements**: Specific samples where judge and ground truth differ

### Example: Improving a JSON Validator

Using calibration data, we improved our JSON validator from 60% to 90% accuracy:

**Version 1** (vague criteria):

```
Exact Match Rate: 60% (6/10)
Average Error: 0.80
```

**Version 2** (precise criteria):

```
Exact Match Rate: 90% (9/10)
Average Error: 0.30
```

The key improvements:

- Clearly distinguished between strict JSON (double quotes) and relaxed syntax
  (single quotes)
- Specified exact scoring for different failure modes (-1 for extra keys, -3 for
  non-JSON)
- Added precise handling of edge cases (e.g., empty JSON when data expected)
