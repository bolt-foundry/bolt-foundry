Both starting pitchers were brilliant, with San Diego's Joe Musgrove throwing 7.2 scoreless innings with 11 strikeouts, while Arizona's Zac Gallen matched him pitch-for-pitch through seven innings.

The Diamondbacks threatened in the ninth, scoring one run and putting the tying run on third base with two outs, but Padres closer Josh Hader struck out Christian Walker to end the game. The win keeps San Diego's wild card hopes alive as they sit 2.5 games behind the final playoff spot with 12 games remaining.","assistantResponse":"Tuesday night's Padres-Diamondbacks game was a classic pitcher's duel - basically, both pitchers were so good that almost nobody could hit! ðŸ”¥ For 7+ innings, the score was 0-0 as Musgrove (Padres) and Gallen (D-backs) were untouchable. The game finally broke open when Ha-Seong Kim barely snuck a home run inside the foul pole for a 2-0 Padres lead. Arizona made it scary in the 9th, scoring once and getting a runner just 90 feet from tying it, but the Padres hung on 2-1. This win is HUGE for San Diego - they're chasing a playoff spot and are now just 2.5 games back with only 12 games left in the season!"}

In the 11th, Rays' pinch hitter Luke Raley hit a walk-off three-run homer to right field. The bullpens combined to allow 9 runs in the final four innings. Both teams used six pitchers each.","assistantResponse":"What an absolutely insane game! The Rays beat the Orioles 11-10 in extra innings with SEVEN home runs total! Baltimore was cruising with an 8-4 lead but Tampa Bay went nuts and tied it 8-8. Then it got really weird - both teams kept scoring in extra innings (games that go past 9 innings). The hero was Luke Raley who came off the bench to hit a walk-off homer in the 11th. A walk-off means the home team wins instantly when they score the go-ahead run in the last inning. Both bullpens were terrible, giving up 9 runs in just 4 innings. This is the kind of game that makes you love baseball - pure chaos! ðŸŽ¢"}
