The game featured multiple lead changes, with the Yankees jumping out to a 4-0 lead in the third inning behind Aaron Judge's two-run homer. Boston clawed back with a five-run fifth inning, highlighted by Rafael Devers' three-run double off the Green Monster. Yankees reliever Clay Holmes, who had been nearly perfect this season with a 0.89 ERA, couldn't hold the lead in the ninth, walking two batters before Casas' heroics. The win moves the Red Sox to within 3.5 games of the Yankees in the AL East standings. Starting pitchers Gerrit Cole (NYY) and Brayan Bello (BOS) both struggled with command, combining for 11 walks. The sold-out crowd of 37,755 was the loudest Fenway has been all season, especially after Casas' hit.","assistantResponse":"Wow, what a Saturday night at Fenway! ðŸŽ‰ The Red Sox beat their biggest rivals, the Yankees, 7-6 in a game that kept flipping back and forth. The Yankees looked dominant early (up 4-0), but the Sox exploded for 5 runs in the fifth inning - including a huge hit by Devers that bounced off the famous Green Monster wall. The real hero was rookie Triston Casas, who got the winning hit in the 9th inning after the Yankees' usually reliable closer walked two batters (huge no-no!). This win is extra sweet because it pulls Boston closer to New York in the division race - now just 3.5 games behind. The crowd of nearly 38,000 was going absolutely nuts!"},"sampleMetadata":{}}
