# Bolt Foundry SDK v0.0 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical implementation for the Bolt Foundry SDK
v0.0, establishing the foundation with a TypeScript-first fluent builder API for
creating structured prompts that compile to OpenAI chat completion format.

## Technical Reasoning

### Why a Builder Pattern?

The builder pattern provides several critical advantages for structured prompt
construction:

1. **Type Safety**: TypeScript's type system can enforce valid method chains at
   compile time
2. **Composability**: Immutable builders allow safe reuse and branching of base
   configurations
3. **Discoverability**: IDE autocomplete guides developers through available
   options
4. **Validation**: Invalid states become impossible to represent

### Why Immutable Builders?

Following functional programming principles and our existing bfDb patterns:

1. **Predictable State**: Each method returns a new instance, preventing
   surprising mutations
2. **Safe Sharing**: Builders can be passed between functions without defensive
   copying
3. **Time Travel**: Intermediate states can be captured and tested independently
4. **Parallel Safety**: Multiple branches can be created from a single base
   configuration

## Core Architecture

### File Structure

```
packages/bolt-foundry/
├── builders/
│   └── builders.ts              (temporary single file for API development)
├── lib/
│   └── BfError.ts               (existing)
├── telemetry/
│   └── connectBoltFoundry.ts    (existing)
├── bolt-foundry.ts              (main exports)
└── __tests__/
    └── SpecBuilder.test.ts      (all builder tests)
```

**Note**: `builders.ts` is our temporary starting point for API definition and
experimentation. As the API stabilizes, we may split this into separate files
for better organization (e.g., `specs.ts`, `builders.ts`, `types.ts`).

### Current Implementation

See the live implementation in [`builders/builders.ts`](/404.md) which contains:

- `Spec` class: Base data structure with `value` (string or Array<Spec>) and
  optional `name`
- `SpecBuilder` class: Immutable builder with `.spec()` for individual values,
  `.specs()` for groups, and `.getSpecs()` to retrieve all specs
- `RenderOptions` type: OpenAI chat completion parameters
- Minimal, flexible API using immutable builder pattern

## Key Architectural Changes

### Simple Spec-Based Architecture

The system uses a minimal, flexible architecture:

1. **Single Spec Class**: All data uses the base `Spec` class with `value` and
   `name` properties
2. **Flexible Value**: `value` can be a string (leaf node) or Array<Spec>
   (container)
3. **Named Groups**: Optional `name` property enables grouping and
   categorization

### Example Usage

```typescript
const pokemonTrainer = createCard("pokemon-trainer", (b) =>
  b.specs("role", (r) =>
    r.spec("You are an experienced Pokemon trainer on a journey to become a Pokemon Master")
  )
  .specs("wants", (w) =>
    w.spec("To be the very best like no one ever was")
      .spec("To catch them all")
      .spec("To travel across the land searching far and wide"))
  .specs("needs", (s) =>
    s
      .spec("Trust and loyalty from Pokemon")
      .spec("Challenging battles to grow")
      .spec("Connection with other trainers"))
  .specs("fears", (s) =>
    s
      .spec("Losing a Pokemon permanently")
      .spec("Being unable to protect those they care about"))
  .specs("values", (s) =>
    s
      .spec("Friendship over victory")
      .spec("Perseverance through hardship"))
  .specs("skills", (s) =>
    s
      .spec("Reading Pokemon emotions")
      .spec("Strategic battle planning"))
  .spec("Optimistic")
  .spec("Empathetic")
  .specs("constraints", (s) =>
    s
      .spec("Always treat Pokemon with respect")
      .spec("Learn from every defeat"));

// Result structure shows flexible composition:
// SpecBuilder {
//   _specs: [
//     Spec { value: "You are an experienced Pokemon trainer...", name: undefined },
//     Spec {
//       value: [
//         Spec { value: "To be the very best like no one ever was", name: undefined },
//         Spec { value: "To catch them all", name: undefined },
//         Spec { value: "To travel across the land searching far and wide", name: undefined }
//       ],
//       name: "wants"
//     },
//     Spec {
//       value: [
//         Spec { value: "Trust and loyalty from Pokemon", name: undefined },
//         Spec { value: "Challenging battles to grow", name: undefined },
//         Spec { value: "Connection with other trainers", name: undefined }
//       ],
//       name: "needs"
//     },
//     Spec { name: "fears", value: [...] },
//     Spec { name: "values", value: [...] },
//     Spec { name: "skills", value: [...] },
//     Spec { value: "Optimistic", name: undefined },
//     Spec { value: "Empathetic", name: undefined },
//     Spec { name: "constraints", value: [...] }
//   ]
// }
```

## Deferred Features

The following features were initially planned but deferred to keep v0.0 minimal:

1. **Advanced Render Options**: Full telemetry integration, custom options
   beyond OpenAI parameters
2. **Persona Card XML Format**: The `<⚡️persona_card⚡️>` XML rendering format
3. **Complex Error Handling**: Validation for edge cases, special characters,
   etc.

These features can be revisited in future versions based on user feedback and
actual usage patterns.

## Summary

Version 0.0 successfully established the foundation for the Bolt Foundry SDK
with:

- Immutable builder pattern following bfDb conventions
- Simple, flexible Spec-based architecture
- Basic card creation and OpenAI rendering
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Deferred package publishing to v0.2 to focus on core functionality

## Technical Decisions

### Immutable Builder Pattern

Following the bfDb pattern, each method returns a new instance:

- Enables safe composition and reuse
- Prevents accidental mutations
- Allows branching from base configurations

### Type-Only OpenAI Dependency

Using `import type` ensures:

- No runtime dependency for users who don't need it
- Full type safety for those who do
- Forward compatibility with OpenAI API changes

### Minimal Documentation

Using brief JSDoc comments:

- Leverages Deno's built-in doc generator
- Provides IDE intellisense
- Keeps focus on shipping v0.1

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Only

Focus on testing individual methods:

- boltFoundryClient.createCard() method
- Card builder method chains
- PersonaBuilder functionality
- ConstraintsBuilder functionality
- Render output format validation
- Error cases (empty card configs, etc.)

### Example Test

```typescript
Deno.test("boltFoundryClient.createCard - renders persona with traits", () => {
  const card = boltFoundryClient.createCard("helpful-assistant", (b) => {
    return b
      .persona((p) =>
        p
          .description("You are helpful")
          .trait("Clear communication")
          .trait("Patient")
      );
  });

  const result = spec.render({ model: "gpt-4" });

  assertEquals(result.messages[0].role, "system");
  assert(result.messages[0].content.includes("You are helpful"));
  assert(
    result.messages[0].content.includes(
      '<⚡️persona_card name="helpful-assistant"⚡️>',
    ),
  );
  assert(result.messages[0].content.includes("Clear communication"));
});
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success

- All unit tests passing
- TypeScript compilation with strict mode
- Clean dnt build to npm package
- No runtime errors in basic usage

### API Success

- Intuitive method chaining
- Clear TypeScript errors for invalid usage
- Renders valid OpenAI payloads
- Maintains immutability throughout

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Unicode/Emoji Issues

**Mitigation**: Test thoroughly across platforms. Have fallback plan for
non-emoji markers if needed.

### Risk: OpenAI Type Changes

**Mitigation**: Pin OpenAI package version in v0.1. Plan migration strategy for
major updates.

### Risk: Builder Complexity

**Mitigation**: Keep v0.1 minimal. Only persona with traits/constraints. Save
behaviors and advanced features for later.

## Next Steps

1. Create feature branch for v0.1 implementation
2. Set up basic file structure
3. Implement PersonaBuilder first (smallest unit)
4. Build up to PromptBuilder
5. Add render logic
6. Write comprehensive unit tests
