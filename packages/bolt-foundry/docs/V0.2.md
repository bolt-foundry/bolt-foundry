# Bolt Foundry SDK v0.1 Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Bolt Foundry SDK v0.1
series, building upon the foundation established in v0.0. The v0.1 series
focuses on advanced features including variables, conversation management, and
integration improvements.

## v0.1 Series Goals

### v0.1.1: Variables System

- [ ] Design variable interpolation system for dynamic content
- [ ] Define variable spec structure (similar to but different from specs)
- [ ] Implement variable builders and composition
- [ ] Create variable validation and type checking
- [ ] Integrate variables with render pipeline
- [ ] Handle variable scoping and inheritance
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for variable system

### v0.1.2: Conversation Management

- [ ] Design conversation management API (.addUser(), .addAssistant(), etc.)
- [ ] Design automatic conversation tracking with connectBoltFoundry integration
- [ ] Implement basic conversation management (manual
      .addUser()/.addAssistant())
- [ ] Create conversation state tracking and immutable updates
- [ ] Handle conversation context and turn management
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for conversation system

### v0.1.3: Advanced Testing

- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests for all builder methods
- [ ] Integration tests for complex spec building scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for large spec trees
- [ ] Error handling and validation tests
- [ ] Type-level tests for builder chains

### v0.1.4: Advanced Conversation Integration

- [ ] Implement automatic conversation tracking in connectBoltFoundry
- [ ] Add response interception and conversation state updates
- [ ] Integrate conversation management with telemetry tracking
- [ ] Handle edge cases (streaming responses, errors, etc.)

### v0.1.5: Integration & Polish

- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing telemetry
- [ ] Add basic error messages
- [ ] Final testing pass
- [ ] Prepare for production release

## Technical Considerations

### Variables System Architecture

The variables system will need to:

- Support both simple string interpolation and complex object variables
- Maintain type safety through the builder chain
- Integrate seamlessly with the existing Spec structure
- Provide runtime validation of variable values

### Conversation Management Design

Conversation tracking should:

- Maintain immutability principles from the builder pattern
- Support both manual and automatic conversation tracking
- Integrate with connectBoltFoundry for transparent tracking
- Handle various OpenAI response formats (streaming, non-streaming)

### Testing Strategy

Advanced testing will focus on:

- Edge cases in builder composition
- Performance with large spec trees
- Type safety across complex builder chains
- Integration with real OpenAI API responses

## Success Criteria

### v0.1.1 Success

- Variables can be defined and interpolated in specs
- Type-safe variable handling
- Clear validation errors for missing/invalid variables

### v0.1.2 Success

- Intuitive conversation management API
- Immutable conversation state updates
- Clear separation between manual and automatic tracking

### v0.1.3 Success

- 100% test coverage for public API
- Performance benchmarks established
- All edge cases documented and tested

### v0.1.4 Success

- Seamless automatic conversation tracking
- No breaking changes to existing connectBoltFoundry usage
- Robust error handling for API failures

### v0.1.5 Success

- Production-ready package
- Comprehensive documentation
- Smooth upgrade path from v0.0
