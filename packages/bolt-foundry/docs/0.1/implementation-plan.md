# Bolt Foundry Library: Version 0.1 Implementation Plan

## Version Goals

This initial version (0.1) establishes the foundation for the Bolt Foundry
library, focusing on the core functionality of intercepting and logging OpenAI
API calls made through the Vercel AI SDK. Our primary goal is to create a
non-invasive way for NextJS developers to gain visibility into their AI
interactions with minimal code changes.

## Components and Implementation Details

### 1. Fetch Interceptor Core

The central component of this version is the fetch interceptor that wraps the
default fetch function to add our tracking capabilities.

```typescript
// Core function signature
export function connectToOpenAi(openAiApiKey: string): typeof fetch {
  return function boltFoundryFetch(
    url: RequestInfo | URL,
    options?: RequestInit,
  ) {
    // Intercept, log, and enhance OpenAI API calls
    // ...
    return fetch(url, modifiedOptions);
  };
}
```

#### Implementation Details

- **Request Detection**: Identify OpenAI API calls by checking URL patterns
  (api.openai.com)
- **Authentication Handling**: Automatically inject API keys into request
  headers
- **Request Metadata Capture**: Store request data for logging
- **Non-Blocking Architecture**: Ensure minimal performance impact on the main
  request flow

### 2. Logging System

We'll implement a logging system that provides developers with detailed insights
during development.

#### Implementation Details

- **Integration with @bolt-foundry/logger**: Use our existing logger package
- **Configurable Log Levels**: Support DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR levels
- **Context-Aware Logging**: Include relevant request/response data
- **Development Mode Enhancement**: More verbose logging in dev environments

### 3. Request/Response Processing

Analyze and enhance OpenAI API interactions without disrupting their
functionality.

#### Implementation Details

- **Header Management**: Preserve existing headers while adding necessary
  authentication
- **Body Parsing**: Read and optionally modify request bodies (model selection,
  etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of parsing errors without breaking the
  original request
- **Response Capturing**: Optional logging of response data for debugging

## Integration Pattern

Developers will integrate Bolt Foundry directly with their OpenAI client:

```typescript
// Where you initialize your OpenAI client:
import { createOpenAiFetch } from "@bolt-foundry/bolt-foundry";
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  fetch: createOpenAiFetch(process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY),
});
```

## Testing Strategy for v0.1

### Unit Tests

- **Test fetch wrapper**: Verify header injection and URL detection
- **Test authentication handling**: Ensure API keys are properly applied
- **Test error resilience**: Confirm that errors don't break the application
  flow

### Manual Testing

- **Integration with sample NextJS app**: Verify seamless operation
- **Performance testing**: Measure overhead of the interceptor
- **Log output verification**: Ensure logs contain expected information

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Non-Invasive Integration

**Solution**: We'll use function wrapping of the global fetch to avoid requiring
changes to existing code beyond the initial setup.

### Challenge: Parsing JSON Safely

**Solution**: Implement try/catch blocks when parsing request bodies to prevent
breaking the application if unexpected formats are encountered.

### Challenge: Minimizing Performance Impact

**Solution**: Keep processing lightweight during the intercept phase, with more
intensive operations (if needed) performed asynchronously.

## Version 0.1 Deliverables

1. **Core Library Code**:
   - `connectToOpenAi` function implementation
   - Logger integration
   - Type definitions for improved developer experience

2. **Documentation**:
   - Installation guide
   - Integration examples
   - API reference

3. **Sample Implementation**:
   - Demo NextJS application showing integration

## Future Considerations (for v0.2+)

- Analytics integration with PostHog
- Batched event processing
- Usage pattern detection
- Cost optimization recommendations

## Success Criteria for v0.1

Version 0.1 will be considered successful when:

1. OpenAI API calls can be intercepted without errors
2. Request headers are properly enhanced with authentication
3. Logging provides useful debugging information
4. Performance impact is negligible
5. Integration requires minimal code changes

This implementation plan provides the detailed technical roadmap for building
Version 0.1 of the Bolt Foundry library, establishing the foundation for the
analytics and optimization features that will follow in later versions.
