# Bolt Foundry library

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial) **Date:** 2025-04-04

## Project Purpose

We're creating a tool that helps startups who use NextJS and the Vercel SDK
track their application usage and send analytics data to PostHog. This will
provide valuable insights into how users interact with their AI features,
helping improve performance and reduce costs.

## Project Versions Overview

1. **Version 0.1: Foundation**
   - Set up a basic NextJS application with chat functionality as a sample
   - Implement library to replace the default fetch call in the Vercel AI SDK
   - Add logging capabilities to console using our logger

2. **Version 0.2: Analytics Integration**
   - Add PostHog event capture functionality
   - Implement proper event tracking for AI interactions
   - Create dashboards for visualizing usage data

3. **Version 0.3: Experimentation Framework**
   - Set up framework for running A/B tests comparing different LLM calls
   - Build comparison reporting tools
   - Add cost tracking features

## User Personas

1. **AI Developer**
   - Needs to understand how users interact with AI features
   - Wants to optimize costs associated with LLM API calls
   - Requires visibility into performance metrics

2. **Product Manager**
   - Needs data to make informed decisions about AI feature development
   - Wants to run experiments to test different approaches
   - Requires simple dashboards showing key metrics

## Success Metrics

- Successfully intercept and log all Vercel AI SDK calls
- Accurately track and report on usage patterns in PostHog
- Provide measurable insights that help reduce API costs
- Enable simple A/B testing of different AI implementations
- Minimal performance impact on the host application

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk**: Performance degradation due to additional tracking
  - **Mitigation**: Batch events and use non-blocking calls

- **Risk**: Privacy concerns with tracking user interactions
  - **Mitigation**: Provide clear documentation on data collection and
    anonymization options

- **Risk**: Compatibility issues with different NextJS versions
  - **Mitigation**: Test across multiple versions and provide version-specific
    documentation
