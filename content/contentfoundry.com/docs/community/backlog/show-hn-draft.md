# Show HN: Content Foundry - Open Source Platform for Cross-Platform Storytelling

## Post Draft

Hi HN,

We're excited to share Content Foundry, an open-source platform we've been
building to help creators tell their stories effectively across all platforms,
including their own.

### What is Content Foundry?

Content Foundry is a content operating system built around five pillars that
cover the entire content creation lifecycle:

1. **Personas**: A Story Bank for anecdotes, brand information, and inspiration
   that serves as origin material
2. **Research**: AI-assisted idea generation based on industry trends and
   audience interests
3. **Creation**: Content creation tools with AI assistance that maintains your
   unique voice
4. **Distribution**: Streamlined publishing across platforms while owning your
   content
5. **Analytics**: Unified tracking to measure success and refine your content
   strategy

### Developer Experience Focus

We believe open-source projects should be accessible and enjoyable to contribute
to. Our goal is to create a developer experience that's better than contributing
to Wikipedia. Here's what we've built:

- **BFF (Bolt Foundry Friend)**: Our custom task runner that simplifies common
  development tasks
- **Replit-first Experience**: One-click setup to start contributing immediately
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guides for every aspect of the project
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Deno 2, React, GraphQL, Sapling SCM, and more

### Why We Built This

After exploring AI + Video and finding it didn't solve real problems, we
realized the core challenge for startups and creators isn't better content
creation toolsâ€”it's knowing what content to create in the first place.

Content Foundry provides a structured system to define, create, distribute, and
measure content efficiently, helping startups develop their content strategy
from day one.

### What We're Looking For

We'd love your feedback on:

1. Developer experience - is it as smooth as we hope?
2. Features you'd like to see in each pillar
3. Integration ideas with existing tools and platforms

Thanks for checking out Content Foundry!
