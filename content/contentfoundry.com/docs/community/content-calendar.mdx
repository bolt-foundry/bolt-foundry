1. Content Calendar Structure

You could follow a simple weekly schedule:
  •	Monday – Story Bank: Personal anecdotes, lessons learned, industry insights.
  •	Tuesday – Deep Dive: A long-form post on a key topic (e.g., open-source, AI in content, Content Foundry updates).
  •	Wednesday – Quick Tips: Short, actionable insights (e.g., a tweet thread or LinkedIn post).
  •	Thursday – Thought Leadership: Opinion pieces on trends in content creation, AI, or entrepreneurship.
  •	Friday – Open-source Focus: Updates, lessons, or behind-the-scenes work on Content Foundry.
  •	Saturday/Sunday – Optional: More reflective posts or casual sharing.

2. Writing Workflow
  •	Idea Capture: Use your Story Bank to log ideas.
  •	Outline: Spend 5-10 minutes structuring the key points.
  •	Draft Quickly: First draft should be rough; refining comes later.
  •	Edit & Post: Keep it concise, clear, and valuable.
