# Show HN Plan & Developer Experience Improvement

## Overview

Content Foundry aims to provide the best developer experience possible. This
document outlines our strategy for improving the developer experience and
preparing for a Show HN post to introduce the project to the wider developer
community.

## Goals

1. Create clear onboarding documentation
2. Improve homepage messaging
3. Prepare compelling Show HN post
4. Ensure seamless developer setup experience

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Homepage Clarity

The homepage should clearly communicate:

- What Content Foundry is (an open-source platform for content creation)
- The five pillars (Personas, Research, Creation, Distribution, Analytics)
- How to get started (clear CTA for developers)
- Project vision and benefits

### Developer Onboarding

Create a streamlined onboarding process:

1. One-click setup in Replit
2. Clear documentation on local setup
3. Tutorial for first contribution
4. Guide to using BFF (Bolt Foundry Friend) tools

### Documentation Structure

Organize documentation into clear sections:

- Getting Started
- Core Concepts
- Contribution Guide
- Feature Documentation
- API Reference

## Show HN Post Strategy

### Post Title

"Show HN: Content Foundry - Open Source Platform for Cross-Platform
Storytelling"

### Post Content Draft

```
Hi HN,

We've been building Content Foundry, an open-source platform designed to help creators tell their stories across all platforms, including their own.

The project has five pillars that cover the entire content creation process:
- Personas: Store and organize brand information and origin materials
- Research: AI-assisted idea generation based on industry trends
- Creation: Content creation tools with AI assistance
- Distribution: Tools to publish content across platforms
- Analytics: Unified tracking to measure success

We're focusing heavily on developer experience, aiming to make contributing to Content Foundry simpler than contributing to Wikipedia.

The project uses Deno 2, React, GraphQL, and features a custom tool called BFF (Bolt Foundry Friend) that handles common development tasks.

We'd love your feedback on:
1. The developer experience
2. Our approach to content creation
3. Features you'd like to see

You can try it immediately on Replit: [REPLIT_LINK]
Or clone the repo: [REPO_LINK]

Thanks!
```

### Preparation Tasks

1. Ensure all documentation is up-to-date
2. Test the onboarding experience with new contributors
3. Prepare answers to potential questions
4. Create a compelling demo video/screenshots
5. Set up a system to track and respond to feedback
