No project exists in a vacuum. There are always customers, coworkers, business
partners, and dozens of other people involved in making something work from
nothing.

When I start a project, I work on it by myself, in isolation, to ensure I
understand what I'm actually trying to do. Once I understand it, I immediately
seek out the partners I need to make it work, and ensure I'm able to build
things that meet their needs as much as my own.
