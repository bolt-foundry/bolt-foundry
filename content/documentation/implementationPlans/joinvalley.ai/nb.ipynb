    "## Dev Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "We're planning to collect two sets of data from Valley:\n",
    "1. **Positive Examples (+3)**: 10 messages that were sent instantly and considered successful responses\n",
    "2. **Negative Examples (-3)**: 10 messages that required multiple regenerations and were never sent\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach aligns perfectly with Phase 2 (Sample Collection & Rating) of our implementation plan, where we'll be developing the `BfSample` structure and implementing a -3 to +3 rating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How This Fits Into Our [Development Plan](/content/documentation/implementaionPlans/firstFimeTune/plan.mdx)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immediate Application (Phase 2)\n",
    "- The samples from Valley will serve as our initial dataset in the `BfSample` structure\n",
    "- The clear binary rating (+3 for good, -3 for bad) provides a straightforward starting point for our rating system\n",
    "- These real-world examples will help validate our basic sample storage and retrieval systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foundation for Future Phases\n",
    "- These samples will be valuable for Phase 2.25 (Automatic Sample Generation), as they'll provide reference points for what good and bad outputs look like\n",
    "- The prompts and regenerations will help inform our prompt templating system\n",
    "- For Phase 2.5 (Initial Fine-tuning), these samples can form the core of our first fine-tuning dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Storage Structure**\n",
    "   - We'll need to store not just the final message but also:\n",
    "     - The original prompt\n",
    "     - Any regenerations (for negative examples)\n",
    "     - Metadata about why certain responses were preferred or rejected\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Relationship Mapping**\n",
    "   - Connect samples to the relevant sections of the identity card\n",
    "   - Track the relationship between prompts and responses\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Focus**\n",
    "   - Verify that we can accurately store and retrieve these examples\n",
    "   - Ensure the rating system properly associates with the samples\n",
    "   - Test basic filtering capabilities based on ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finalize our `BfSample` data model to accommodate Valley's examples\n",
    "2. Create a simple import process for these initial samples\n",
    "3. Develop a basic visualization to display the samples with their ratings\n",
    "4. Implement functionality to compare good vs. bad responses to the same prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "This collaboration with Valley provides an excellent opportunity to test our Phase 2 implementation with real-world data, which will help us validate our approach before moving to the more complex automatic generation and fine-tuning phases."
