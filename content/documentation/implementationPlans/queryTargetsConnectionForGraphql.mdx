# Implementation Plan: queryTargetsConnectionForGraphql for BfNodeBase

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the approach for adding a
`queryTargetsConnectionForGraphql` method to the `BfNodeBase` class, with
concrete implementation in the `BfNode` class. This method will enable efficient
GraphQL Relay-style connections for target nodes, providing consistent
cursor-based pagination capabilities across the GraphQL API.

## Background

The Content Foundry platform currently has a `queryTargets` method in
`BfNodeBase` that returns an array of target node instances. While this works
for simple queries, it doesn't support the GraphQL Connection pattern which is
essential for:

1. Standardized pagination with cursor-based navigation
   (first/after/last/before)
2. Consistent edge data structure
3. Connection metadata (count, pageInfo)

Looking at existing code in `packages/bfDb/bfDb.ts`, we can see the
`bfQueryItemsForGraphQLConnection` function which implements proper cursor-based
pagination for GraphQL connections. This approach is more efficient than using
`connectionFromArray` from graphql-relay, as it performs pagination at the
database level rather than in memory.

## Technical Design

### Architecture

The implementation will follow the BfNodeBase/BfNode pattern in the codebase:

1. `BfNodeBase` will define the abstract method with a "not implemented" default
2. `BfNode` will provide the concrete implementation using database-level
   pagination

### Method Signature in BfNodeBase

```typescript
async queryTargetsConnectionForGraphql<
  TTargetProps extends BfNodeBaseProps,
  TTargetClass extends typeof BfNodeBase<TTargetProps>,
>(
  TargetClass: TTargetClass,
  args: ConnectionArguments,
  props: Partial<TTargetProps> = {},
  edgeProps: Partial<TEdgeProps> = {},
  cache?: BfNodeCache,
): Promise<Connection<ReturnType<InstanceType<TTargetClass>['toGraphql']>>> {
  throw new BfErrorNotImplemented();
}
```

### Implementation Approach in BfNode

The implementation in BfNode will:

1. Build metadata and props queries for the edge relationship
2. Use `bfQueryItemsForGraphQLConnection` from bfDb.ts to get a cursor-based
   paginated connection
3. Map the returned database items to GraphQL-formatted target instances
4. Return a properly structured connection object

## Implementation Details

### BfNodeBase Implementation (Abstract)

The abstract base class will throw a "not implemented" error, consistent with
other abstract methods.

### BfNode Implementation (Concrete)

The implementation will leverage the existing `bfQueryItemsForGraphQLConnection`
function which handles cursor-based pagination at the database level. This will
be more efficient than the initial approach of using `connectionFromArray` as it
avoids retrieving all items before pagination.

Key steps:

1. Build edge metadata query with source ID and target class name
2. Pass connection arguments directly to database layer
3. Transform result nodes to their GraphQL representation
4. Return structured connection object with count and pageInfo

## Integration with GraphQL Schema

This method will enable GraphQL schema types to define connection fields that
follow the Relay connection specification. Resolvers will be able to call this
method directly to implement connection fields.

## Considerations

1. **Performance**: Using cursor-based pagination at the database level is much
   more efficient than retrieving all results first.

2. **Edge Data**: The connection includes edge metadata, which allows passing
   relationship data between nodes.

3. **Cache Usage**: The implementation should properly use and update the node
   cache.

4. **Type Safety**: Ensure proper typing for GraphQL connections.

## Testing Strategy

1. Test the BfNodeBase implementation to ensure it throws the correct error
2. Test the BfNode implementation with:
   - Different pagination parameters (first, after, last, before)
   - Various numbers of connected nodes
   - Edge cases (empty results, invalid cursors)
   - Cache functionality
3. Integration tests with GraphQL resolvers

## Testing Strategy

1. Test with a mock in-memory implementation
2. Test with different pagination parameters (first, after, last, before)
3. Test edge cases (empty results, invalid cursors)
4. Integration tests with GraphQL resolvers

## Conclusion

Adding `queryTargetsConnectionForGraphql` to `BfNodeBase` will standardize how
we implement connections in our GraphQL API, making it easier to add pagination
to new and existing queries while maintaining a consistent interface.
