# Facebook's lack of storytelling cost billions and killed the brand

Companies that don't tell their own story are repeating Facebook's billion
dollar mistake.

[I joined Facebook officially in 2018](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/13/facebook-vidpresso/),
but started working with the company as a partner in 2014. Early on, our company
Vidpresso rode Facebook's success into our own company's success, and we had a
front row seat watching Facebook go from
[beloved tech titan](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Facebook_Effect/PxTvbM-VCPEC)
to [punching bag](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/29/1/zmad039/7394122).

Why did Facebook's reputation swing so wildly?

Early on, the company thrived by focusing on technical quality and relied on its
users to spread the narrative. Eventually, external forces and political actors
usurped the narrative to tell their own stories about Facebook, benefitting them
at Facebook's expense.

Today's founders should take note.

1. If your story is being told in a way that connects with your customers,
   growth will happen organically.
1. Marketing optimization gets simpler if your core story is intact and
   spreading.
1. If you don't tell your story, it isn't your story; others will own it and use
   it to reap the benefits.

## Facebook focused on tech, and that was the right call

[MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) and
[Friendster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster) both predated Facebook in
ubiquity and popularity. But MySpace's product was not designed (they depended
on you to design it), and Friendster couldn't stay up because of engineering
challenges with scale.

Engineer Mark Zuckerberg found it fun to keep the servers up. After
[Facebook's 2004 launch at Harvard](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/9/hundreds-register-for-new-facebook-website/),
where 1,000+ students signed up in the first week, Facebook would roll out at
its own pace, as fast as they could rack up servers.

Because they spread campus to campus, they also spread student to student. The
first universities to get access were Columbia, Stanford, and Yale... and
instead of having a splashy on-campus launch party to get attention, the company
simply allowed users with columbia.edu emails to sign up.

After the first student signed up, probably from a friend at Harvard, students
would tell other students, till eventually the network saturated a campus.

While students were clamoring to get onto the platform, Zuck had to keep writing
code and hiring engineers. Zuck and Facebook didn't need to tell any stories, so
they didn't. Technological scaling was ultimately more important, and
contributed more to their success than any marketing could have.

One of the company's first employees, current CPO
[Chris Cox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Cox_(technologist)), is actually
an incredible storyteller. For years, he was the first Facebook executive every
employee would meet, hosting the Monday onboarding session for new employees. He
explained the ideas behind the social graph, emphasized the idea that "This is
now your company," meaning as an employee you can now shepherd the company in
whatever direction you want, and explained that social media's role in society
is not neutral... the employees would shape how social media affects society for
good or for ill.

As the company scaled employees, it told its story internally very effectively,
but that internal storytelling didn't translate to external storytelling.

When the company opened the product to everyone, journalists and pop culture
started to spread the gospel of Zuck.
[The New Yorker published an in-depth profile of Zuck](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook),
the movie [The Social Network](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/) hit
theaters, and mentions in [The Office](https://youtu.be/3Q9rewnLFYw), among
others, meant Facebook was flying high. The company hit 500 million users
in 2010.

## Pop Culture and Politics Shift the Story

Two months after the release of the film, a Tunisian street vendor named
[Mohamed Bouazizi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi) created a
private Facebook group with 300,000 members discussing police corruption.
Subsequently,
[Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mohamed-Bouazizi).

A few weeks later, a musician named
[Hamada Ben Amor (aka El General)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_General)
released a rap song called "Rais Lebled" exclusively on Facebook. The song
became an anthem for the impending
[Jasmine Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunisian_Revolution), much of
which played out on the platform.

These events signaled a dramatic shift in the company's perception in the world.
No longer the plucky technological upstart, Facebook had become political.
Throughout North Africa and the Middle East, protest movements spread in the
[Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring).

Now, journalists and academics switched the story from connecting students and
families to connecting political actors.

Eventually, that became the exclusive story about the company. Politicians
seized on the platform, and with journalists' help, the terms "misinformation"
and "fake news" drove the narrative of the 2016 election. Eventually, Zuck and
other social media CEOs testified in front of the US Congress about
misinformation, and Facebook suffered a spate of "move fast and break things"
issues related to privacy.

## Facebook, Inc. is Replaced by Meta

Public perception of Facebook dipped, and it affected the company's ability to
launch new products. Each new launch spurred articles criticizing Facebook's
privacy policies, and attempts to tie brands like Instagram and Oculus closer to
Facebook increasingly challenged Facebook's ability to shape its own public
perception.

Eventually, Facebook had to rebrand as
[Meta](https://about.meta.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/) to
unify its portfolio of products. If Facebook had told its own authentic story
more frequently and publicly, it might have been able to retain some of its
early goodwill instead of losing control of the Facebook story.

## Silicon Valley's Takeaway: Focus on Growth, Not Story?

Facebook's hesitance to tell its own story led to the brand taking a backseat.
Through a huge amount of time, effort, cost, and leadership from Zuck, things
seem to have worked out for Meta.

However, following Facebook's strategy is not the right playbook for most
startups today.

Startups are not at the mercy of technological challenges threatening their
company's existence. Plenty of other issues can fill that vacuum for founders,
but without carving space to tell their story, any subsequent marketing,
fundraising, or recruiting efforts will be much more challenging than needed.

At Facebook, marketing meant growth. Having users friend other users was the
core feature of the product, so growth teams were marketing optimization teams.
These teams weren't focused on storytelling (story-led growth) but instead on
optimizing products and sign-up pages for moving users through the funnel
efficiently (marketing optimization).

That worked because students and eventually journalists spread the word on their
own, and the product's retention was insanely high. Fixing the bottom-of-funnel
was the problem for Facebook since their top-of-funnel was already full.

Engineer-founded startups take this lesson without applying the full funnel.
It's simple to focus on marketing optimization because it's a math problem. If
you have content, show it to users, you can measure the click-through rate all
the way to retention rate. Paying money to put that content in front of users
means your top of funnel is solved, but each incremental user joining the funnel
costs money.

Content must do more than boost your bottom-of-funnel metrics.

## What Should Startups Do Today?

The lesson is clear: To grow widely, someone needs to tell your story.
Subsequent social networks figured that out. TikTok is the place for pop
culture, personal expression, and trends. Snapchat is the platform for personal
connection. ~~Twitter~~ X is the place for public conversation, and Bluesky is
telling its story as the non-Elon, open protocol alternative to Twitter.

Growth marketing optimizations are still important, but they'll cost more and be
less effective.

Startups that ignore story-led growth do so at their own peril. Founders already
have to tell their story to attract employees, customers, investors and
countless other stakeholders. Today, finding ways to tell your story at scale is
no longer optional. We'll explain some ways through our blog over the next few
postsâ€¦ and we'll start to tell our own story. Stay tuned.
