# Mocks Documentation Project Plan

## User Goals

- Create reliable, consistent test data for unit tests without hitting real APIs
- Simplify test writing by providing ready-to-use mock objects
- Enable tests to run faster by eliminating network dependencies
- Make tests more predictable by controlling data inputs

## Current Problem Statement

Rather than writing different ways to import mocks in each test file, we need to
centralize our mocks and ensure that when bff test runs, it should use a
standard import map as a priority over the standard import map.

## Project Versions

### Version 0.1 (Initial Implementation)

- Create centralized mock directory structure
- Implement basic mocking utilities
- Set up import map configuration for tests

## User Journeys

1. **Test Writer Journey**
   - Developer needs to write a test for code that uses an external API
   - Developer imports appropriate mock from central repository
   - Developer customizes mock data for specific test case
   - Test runs quickly and predictably without external dependencies

2. **Mock Creator Journey**
   - Developer identifies need for new mock
   - Developer follows standard template to create mock
   - Developer documents usage and customization options
   - Mock is available for immediate use in tests

## Future work

### Version 0.2 (First Release)

- Add comprehensive documentation for all mocks
- Implement type-safe mock generators
- Create test helpers for common mock scenarios

### Version 0.3 (Refinement)

- Add snapshot testing support
- Create validation utilities for mock data
- Improve performance of mock generation
