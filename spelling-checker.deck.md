errors using max subagents.

## Task

Find a file in this repository that has a spelling error. Return the file path
and the specific spelling error you found.

## Instructions

1. Search through files in the repository
2. Look for common spelling mistakes in comments, documentation, variable names,
   or string literals
3. Return the first spelling error you find with:
   - File path
   - The misspelled word
   - The correct spelling
   - Line number if possible
