# 1. Executive Summary

## Mission & Context

Bolt Foundry is building the operating system for LLMs. We're transforming Large
Language Model development from unreliable, ad-hoc prompt engineering into
structured, engineering-rigorous systems that achieve 99% reliability. We solve
the critical problems plaguing today's LLM development: unreliable systems,
unmaintainable code, untestable components, and scaling challenges.

## Current State & Opportunity

We're a five-person team in alpha phase with core CLI tools, SDK, and two paying
customers at $1k/month each. Our cards/decks/graders methodology has been
validated, and we have an active demo pipeline from cold outreach efforts.

The market opportunity is clear: while most companies accept "good enough" 90%
AI reliability, those achieving 99% reliability will dominate their markets.
Customer feedback confirms that everyone needs evaluations but most don't know
where to start. This creates a huge opportunity for our guided, automated
approach.

## H2 2024 Objectives

Our H2 strategy centers on four critical objectives:

1. **Complete development of Bolt Foundry v1** - Ship production-ready platform
   with automated RLHF feedback loop, multi-dimensional grader generation, and
   seamless stack integration
2. **Onboard 10 customers** - Scale from two to 10 paying customers by end of
   August to validate product-market fit with >8/10 satisfaction scores
3. **Complete $2M seed funding round** - Secure strategic investors and extend
   runway through next development phase
4. **Prepare for growth phase** - Build foundation for scaling with v2 roadmap,
   team expansion plans, and operational processes

## Core Product Bet

Our primary product vision is an automated reliability loop where developers
simply upload LLM output samples, our system auto-generates multiple graders
(one for each dimension), integrates seamlessly into their stack, continuously
evaluates new samples, and automatically optimizes prompts based on performance
data. This "no brainer" integration addresses the universal need for dynamic
prompt handling while solving the evaluation knowledge gap.

## Key Challenges & Mitigation

**Execution Risk**: Can we build fast enough? We'll mitigate by ruthless feature
prioritization, parallel development tracks, and early customer beta testing.

**Competitive Risk**: Can we stay ahead of larger players? We'll focus on
superior developer experience, rapid customer-driven iteration, and establishing
a respected voice around context engineering.

## Success Metrics

- **Primary (Q3)**: v1 shipped, 10 customers onboarded, seed round closed
- **Q4**: Grow usage as much as possible and keep shipping product
- **Secondary**: Customer retention >90%, product usage metrics trending up
- **Leading Indicators**: Demo conversion rate [TBD%], customer engagement
  scores [TBD threshold], feature adoption rates [TBD%]

This plan represents our path from alpha to market leadership in AI reliability
infrastructure, positioning Bolt Foundry as the foundational layer every LLM
application needs to achieve production-grade reliability.

# 2. Strategy Overview

## Mission & Vision

**Bolt Foundry is building the operating system for LLMs**. We're transforming
Large Language Model development from unreliable, ad-hoc prompt engineering into
structured, engineering-rigorous systems that achieve 99% reliability.

We solve the four critical problems plaguing today's LLM development:

- **Unreliable systems**: One prompt change breaks unrelated functionality
- **Unmaintainable code**: No structure, reusability, or clear interfaces
- **Untestable components**: Can't verify individual pieces work correctly
- **Scaling challenges**: Each new use case starts from scratch

## Where We Are Now vs. Where We Want to Go

### Current State (H1 2024)

- **Alpha phase product** (v0.1-0.5) with core CLI tools and SDK
- **Developer tools foundation**: aibff CLI, structured prompt building APIs
- **Open source approach** with growing developer interest
- **Five-person team** in alpha phase
- **Early validation** of our cards/decks/graders methodology
- **Two paying customers** at $1k/month each with active pipeline of demo
  meetings

### Target State (End of H2 2024)

- **Production-ready v1 platform** with web GUI and full feature set
- **Functioning marketing engine** that consistently generates qualified leads
  and converts customers
- **$2M seed funding** secured to accelerate growth and team expansion
- **Fully scaled operations** ready to handle rapid customer growth beyond
  initial 10 customers
- **Market positioning** as the go-to infrastructure for reliable LLM
  development

## Guiding Strategic Themes

### 1. Infrastructure-First Philosophy

Position Bolt Foundry as foundational infrastructure that every LLM application
needs: similar to how Microsoft became the standard for computing. We're not
just another tool, we're the operating system layer.

### 2. 99% Reliability Differentiator

While competitors accept "good enough" reliability, we enable companies to
achieve 99% reliability through structured prompt engineering. This reliability
gap is our key competitive moat.

### 3. Developer Experience Excellence

Open source foundation with freemium monetization, familiar patterns for easy
adoption, and gradual migration paths that don't require full rewrites of
existing systems.

### 4. Inference-Time Control

Focus on controlling AI behavior at runtime through our cards/decks/graders
system rather than hoping models behave correctly. This gives developers true
control over LLM applications.
