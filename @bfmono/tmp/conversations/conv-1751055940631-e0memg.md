Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. We'll create a grader that evaluates specific dimensions of the comments. 

To start, what dimension would you like your grader to evaluate? This could be anything related to the content of the comment, such as its relevance to a specific topic or theme.
