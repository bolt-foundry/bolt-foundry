Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. To get started, could you let me know what specific dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate? For example, are you focusing on a particular topic like gaming, cooking, or educational content?

Can you help me test persistence?

Absolutely! We can create a grader to evaluate YouTube comments based on their persistence of a specific subject over time. 
To clarify, are we looking to see how well a comment maintains a focus on a particular topic or theme across multiple comments or discussions? If so, please provide the specific topic you'd like the grader to focus on. Once we have that, I can help you draft the markdown for the grader!

Testing conversation loading functionality

Got it! It sounds like you're testing the conversation loading functionality. We can still proceed with creating a topic classifier for YouTube comments as an example. 

Let's start by selecting a specific topic you'd like to use for the grader. It could be anythingâ€”from movies to technology. Once we have a topic established, I can help you draft the markdown to define the grader. What topic would you like to focus on?
