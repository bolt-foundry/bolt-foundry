Hello! I'm here to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments as our example. Let's get started by identifying the specific dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate. 

Are you looking to evaluate comments based on their relevance to a particular topic, sentiment, or perhaps something else? Let me know your preference, and we can dive right in!
