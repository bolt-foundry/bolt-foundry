Hello! I’m here to help you build a grader for a classification task. As an example, let's create a topic classifier for YouTube comments. 
To get started, could you tell me what specific dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate? For instance, are you focusing on a particular topic within YouTube comments, such as video content, user engagement, or another aspect?

Can you help me test persistence?

Sure! If you'd like to build a grader that evaluates YouTube comments specifically for persistence, we can focus on how well comments reflect the idea of persistence or determination in relation to the video's content.

Here's a draft for your grader definition:

```markdown
# YouTube Comment Persistence Classifier

This grader evaluates whether a YouTube comment reflects the theme of persistence.

## Scoring Guidelines

- **+3**: Clearly and directly expresses persistence
- **+2**: Mostly about persistence with minor digressions
- **+1**: Partially relevant to persistence
- **0**: Cannot determine / Invalid input
- **-1**: Slightly off-topic regarding persistence
- **-2**: Mostly off-topic regarding persistence
- **-3**: Completely unrelated to persistence

## Examples

[Examples will be added as we work through them together]
```
