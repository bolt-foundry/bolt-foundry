Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments today. We'll work together to define the dimension your grader will evaluate and create some sample classifications.
To start, what specific dimension would you like your grader to focus on? For example, you might want to evaluate comments based on whether they are about a particular topic, theme, or sentiment. Let me know your thoughts!
