Can you help me test persistence?

Sure! For testing persistence, we can create a grader that evaluates comments based on whether they display a consistent theme or topic. Would you like to focus on a particular topic, or should we create a general persistence evaluator? Let me know your preference!

It seems like you're interested in testing functionality related to conversation loading. To clarify, are you looking to create a grader that assesses comments based on how consistently they adhere to a certain topic or theme over multiple comments or responses? If so, we can define that. 

If you meant something else regarding conversation loading functionality, please provide a bit more detail so I can assist you effectively!
