Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. To get started, could you please tell me what specific dimension you would like your grader to evaluate? For example, is there a particular topic or theme related to the comments that you have in mind?

It seems like you might be testing the interface. If you want to proceed with building your YouTube comment classifier or provide details about the dimension you'd like to evaluate, feel free to share! Just let me know what specific topic or theme you're interested in, and we can continue from there.
