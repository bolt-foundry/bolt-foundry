Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. This is a great way to evaluate the relevance of comments to specific topics.

To get started, could you tell me which specific dimension or topic you'd like your grader to evaluate? For example, are you thinking of a certain theme, like "music", "education", or something else?
