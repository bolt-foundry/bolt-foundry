Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. To get started, could you tell me what specific dimension or topic you'd like your grader to evaluate? This could be anything from the content of the comment, its sentiment, or even specific themes within a video's context. Let me know your thoughts!
