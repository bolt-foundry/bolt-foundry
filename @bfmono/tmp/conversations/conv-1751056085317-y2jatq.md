Hello! I'm excited to assist you in building a topic classifier for YouTube comments. This will help you evaluate comments based on a specific dimension. 
To get started, what dimension would you like your grader to evaluate? For example, we could focus on a specific topic like "video games," "cooking," or even something broader. Let me know what you're thinking!
