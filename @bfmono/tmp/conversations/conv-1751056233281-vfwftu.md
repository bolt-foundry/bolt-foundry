Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments today. This will allow you to evaluate comments based on a specific dimension. To get started, could you please tell me what dimension you want your grader to evaluate? For example, are you interested in a specific topic like "gaming," "cooking," or "travel"?
