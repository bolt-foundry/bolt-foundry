Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. This is a great way to classify and evaluate the content of comments based on specific dimensions.
To start, could you tell me what dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate? For example, are you looking for comments related to a specific topic, such as movies, gaming, education, or something else?

Can you help me test persistence?

Certainly! Testing for persistence in comments could involve evaluating how well a comment engages with a topic or maintains a certain theme over time or within a discussion. 

To help define your grader, we can focus on dimensions like consistency in opinions, recurring themes, or connection to the subject matter across different comments. 

How about we create a preliminary version of your grader? We can start by defining the scoring guidelines. Here’s a suggestion for the grading structure:

```markdown
# YouTube Comment Persistence Classifier

This grader evaluates the persistence of a commentary theme or topic within YouTube comments over time.

## Scoring Guidelines

- **+3**: Consistently focused on the same theme/topic throughout the comment.
- **+2**: Generally consistent with minor variations in theme or topic.
- **+1**: Occasionally maintains the theme but has significant digressions or shifts.
- **0**: Cannot determine / Invalid input.
- **-1**: Shows some persistence but is largely off-topic.
- **-2**: Mostly inconsistent with the theme/topic.
- **-3**: No persistence; completely off-topic.

## Examples

[Examples will be added as we work through them together]

Feel free to modify any part of this, or let me know how you’d like to adjust it! We can also work together on defining examples for the grader.
