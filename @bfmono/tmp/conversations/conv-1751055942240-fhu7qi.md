Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. We'll start by defining the specific dimension you want your grader to evaluate. 
What topic would you like the grader to focus on? For example, it could be about gaming, cooking, technology, or any other specific subject you're interested in. Let me know!

It seems like you might be testing functionality rather than focusing on a specific topic for the YouTube comment classifier. If you're ready to move forward, please let me know what dimension or topic youâ€™d like to have for the classifier, and we can get started!
