Hello! I'm here to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. Let's
start by defining the dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate. What
specific topic or aspect of YouTube comments do you want to focus on? For
example, it could be related to the content of a video, the general theme of the
comment, or any other specific angle you're interested in.

It looks like you're having some fun! If you're ready to dive in, let’s get back
on track to building your YouTube comment classifier. What specific topic or
dimension would you like the grader to evaluate? For example, you could focus on
whether the comments are about the video’s main subject, the creator, humor,
etc. Let me know your thoughts!
