Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. This will enable you to evaluate comments based on a specific dimension. 

To start, could you please tell me what dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate? For example, would you like it to focus on the topic of the comments, the sentiment, or something else?

Absolutely! I'm here to help you create a grader. To begin, could you tell me what specific dimension you'd like your grader to evaluate? For instance, are you interested in classifying comments based on their topic, sentiment, or something else entirely?
