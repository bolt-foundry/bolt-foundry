Hello! I'm excited to help you build a topic classifier for YouTube comments. This will be a great way to evaluate specific dimensions of the comments. 

To get started, what specific dimension do you want your grader to evaluate? For example, you might want to focus on whether comments are about a specific topic related to the video content. Let me know what you have in mind!

Absolutely! I'm here to help you create a grader. Letâ€™s start by defining what dimension you want to evaluate. Do you have a specific focus in mind for this grader, such as assessing whether YouTube comments are on topic, off-topic, or possibly about a specific subject? Let me know!
