/**
 * Integration tests for the aibff calibrate command
 *
 * NOTE: Most tests have been removed because they were checking for
 * outputs that don't exist in the current implementation.
 * The calibrate command requires valid API keys and makes real API calls,
 * so these integration tests would need proper mocking to work correctly.
