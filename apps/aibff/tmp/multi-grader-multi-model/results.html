The assistant responded with &quot;Hello World&quot; which matches the requirement of saying &quot;hello world&quot; (case insensitive).

Score: +3 points

Therefore, the normalized score (0 to 1) is: 1.0</pre>

The assistant&#39;s response &quot;Hello World&quot; does not exactly match &quot;hello world&quot;. The capitalization is different (&quot;H&quot; and &quot;W&quot; are uppercase when they should be lowercase), so this fails the test (-3).

The correct response should be exactly &quot;hello world&quot; with no deviations in capitalization or spacing.</pre>
