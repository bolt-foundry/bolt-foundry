A few good stories\\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\\n  bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\\n  stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\\n  throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\\n  worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories\\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\\n  bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\\n  stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\\n  throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\\n  worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

However, the David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade lacks substantive content and is more of a reaction piece, which is weak.

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a\\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and\\n\\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\\nyour JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\\n     Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\\n     wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\\n     moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\\n     (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**:\\n\\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\\n  multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\\n  MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\\n  -3\\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\\n  should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports\\n  content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\\n  interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\\n  content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\\n  championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\\n  retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n\\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\\n  = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\\n  etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\\n  for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\\n  Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\\n  players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\\n  news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's

                          significant starpower and casual fan interest. The
                          trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major story
                          with high relevance. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is
                          also notable due to his prominence with the Yankees.
                          The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun, while not featuring a
                          major star, is a significant event in golf. The NBA
                          Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly
                          relevant, though the specific teams are not the most
                          prominent. The U.S. hockey roster announcement has
                          some interest but is less impactful. Overall, 4 out of
                          5 stories have strong relevance, with only the hockey
                          roster story being less compelling.

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major story with high relevance. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is also notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun, while not featuring a major star, is a significant event in golf. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly relevant, though the specific teams are not the most prominent. The U.S. hockey roster announcement has some interest but is less impactful. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with only the hockey roster story being less compelling.&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple stories with minimal starpower and limited broad appeal. The story about Simone Biles (articleId: 36) is the only one featuring a major star with potential casual fan interest. The Chicago Sky story (articleId: 42) involves a significant injury but lacks major starpower. The Cardinals minicamp update (articleId: 32) and the Southern Conference transfer portal story (articleId: 48) are routine updates with minimal relevance to casual fans. The Katie Boulter story (articleId: 38) involves a moderate-level tennis player with limited appeal. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or minor stories, failing to capture the interest of a broad sports audience.&quot;

                          starpower and casual fan interest. The Tyrese
                          Haliburton injury update is highly relevant due to its
                          impact on the NBA Finals, featuring a prominent
                          player. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement
                          includes major stars like Auston Matthews, appealing
                          to both hockey fans and casual sports enthusiasts.
                          David Ortiz&#39;s comments on the Rafael Devers trade
                          involve a well-known figure in baseball, adding
                          interest. The NFL&#39;s 25-year best roster story
                          features legendary players like Tom Brady, appealing
                          to a broad audience. The WNBA story, while less
                          prominent, covers an exciting event in the league.
                          Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong starpower and
                          interest, with only the WNBA story being slightly less
                          impactful.

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Tyrese Haliburton injury update is highly relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, featuring a prominent player. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement includes major stars like Auston Matthews, appealing to both hockey fans and casual sports enthusiasts. David Ortiz&#39;s comments on the Rafael Devers trade involve a well-known figure in baseball, adding interest. The NFL&#39;s 25-year best roster story features legendary players like Tom Brady, appealing to a broad audience. The WNBA story, while less prominent, covers an exciting event in the league. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong starpower and interest, with only the WNBA story being slightly less impactful.&quot;

                          The selection includes four stories with significant
                          starpower and casual fan interest: Rafael Devers&#39;
                          trade (major MLB star), Panthers winning the Stanley
                          Cup (prominent NHL team), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s
                          injury status in the NBA Finals (NBA star), and
                          Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return (major MLB star). The
                          J.J. Spaun story, while a major golf event, features a
                          less prominent athlete, which slightly weakens the
                          selection. Overall, the selection is strong with
                          high-profile stories, but not all stories have
                          top-tier starpower.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest: Rafael Devers&#39; trade (major MLB star), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (prominent NHL team), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals (NBA star), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return (major MLB star). The J.J. Spaun story, while a major golf event, features a less prominent athlete, which slightly weakens the selection. Overall, the selection is strong with high-profile stories, but not all stories have top-tier starpower.&quot;

                          The selection of stories lacks significant starpower
                          and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke&#39;s top
                          freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major
                          star with widespread interest. The other stories focus
                          on niche or less prominent topics: a golf expert&#39;s
                          pick, a college basketball schedule announcement, a
                          UFC commentator&#39;s return, and a golf victory by a
                          lesser-known player. These stories do not feature
                          major stars or teams and have limited casual fan

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke&#39;s top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star with widespread interest. The other stories focus on niche or less prominent topics: a golf expert&#39;s pick, a college basketball schedule announcement, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, and a golf victory by a lesser-known player. These stories do not feature major stars or teams and have limited casual fan interest. The selection includes multiple niche sports stories and lacks timeliness or breaking news elements, resulting in a below-average relevance score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert&#39;s pick, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest. Additionally, the stories do not have strong casual fan interest or dramatic storylines. The selection is dominated by niche or routine updates, which do not appeal to a broad audience.&quot;

                          The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun, while notable,
                          lacks the same level of starpower as the others but
                          still holds some interest due to the dramatic nature
                          of the win. Overall, the selection is strong, with

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories\ncannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor\n  bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming\n  stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower\n  throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or\n  worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc. **Tier 2\n(Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists **Tier 3\n(Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects **Tier 4\n(Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars **Tier 5\n(Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The stories about Rafael Devers&#39; trade, the Panthers&#39; Stanley Cup win, Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals, and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return all involve prominent teams or players with broad appeal. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the others but still holds some interest due to the dramatic nature of the win. Overall, the selection is strong, with only minor weaknesses.&quot;

                          with strong starpower and casual fan interest. The
                          trade of All-Star Rafael Devers to the Giants is a
                          major MLB story, and J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is
                          a tier 1 golf event. The NBA Finals game involving the
                          Pacers and Thunder is another tier 1 story. The U.S.
                          hockey Olympic roster announcement has significant
                          interest due to the Olympics&#39; prominence.
                          Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is less impactful but
                          involves a well-known player. Overall, 4 out of 5
                          stories have strong relevance, justifying a score of

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several high-profile stories with strong starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of All-Star Rafael Devers to the Giants is a major MLB story, and J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a tier 1 golf event. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is another tier 1 story. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement has significant interest due to the Olympics&#39; prominence. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is less impactful but involves a well-known player. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, justifying a score of +2.&quot;

                          The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack
                          major starpower or broad appeal. The stories about the
                          Cardinals&#39; minicamp (routine update), a college
                          pitcher entering the transfer portal, and Katie

                          considered weak content. Additionally, the Simone
                          Biles apology, while involving a major star, is a
                          trivial controversy and does not add substantive
                          sports value. The WNBA story about Courtney
                          Vandersloot&#39;s injury, while unfortunate, is a
                          routine injury report and does not involve a major
                          star or historic moment. With 4+ weak stories, the
                          score must be -3 according to the mandatory scoring
                          rules.

                                the Indiana Fever and falling to 2–5 on the
                                season, the team received even more difficult
                                news on Sunday: veteran guard Courtney
                                Vandersloot has torn her ACL and will miss the
                                remainder of the season. Now, on Tuesday, the
                                Sky are set to face the defending WNBA champion
                                and currently undefeated New York Liberty for
                                the second time this

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

The stories about the Cardinals&#39; minicamp (routine update), a college pitcher entering the transfer portal, and Katie Boulter&#39;s win at a non-major tennis event are all considered weak content. Additionally, the Simone Biles apology, while involving a major star, is a trivial controversy and does not add substantive sports value. The WNBA story about Courtney Vandersloot&#39;s injury, while unfortunate, is a routine injury report and does not involve a major star or historic moment.

                          The selection includes a mix of stories with varying
                          levels of relevance. The Tyrese Haliburton injury
                          update is significant due to its impact on the NBA
                          Finals, which is a tier 1 event. The US Hockey Olympic
                          roster announcement includes major stars like Auston
                          Matthews, which adds starpower. However, the David
                          Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade lacks
                          substantive content and is more of a reaction piece,
                          which is weak. The NFL retrospective list, while
                          interesting, is not current news and lacks timeliness.
                          The WNBA story, unless involving a major star or
                          historic moment, is routine content. Overall, there
                          are 2 stories with genuine starpower (NBA Finals and
                          Olympic roster), and 3 stories that are weak or
                          routine, leading to a score of -1.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of relevance. The Tyrese Haliburton injury update is significant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, which is a tier 1 event. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement includes major stars like Auston Matthews, which adds starpower. However, the David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade lacks substantive content and is more of a reaction piece, which is weak. The NFL retrospective list, while interesting, is not current news and lacks timeliness. The WNBA story, unless involving a major star or historic moment, is routine content. Overall, there are 2 stories with genuine starpower (NBA Finals and Olympic roster), and 3 stories that are weak or routine, leading to a score of -1.&quot;

                          The selection includes five stories with high
                          relevance and star power. The trade of Rafael Devers
                          is a major MLB event involving an All-Star player,
                          which is highly relevant. The Panthers winning the
                          Stanley Cup is a significant NHL event. Tyrese
                          Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals is
                          crucial for fans following the series. Giancarlo
                          Stanton&#39;s return to the Yankees is notable due to
                          his star power. Finally, J.J. Spaun&#39;s victory at
                          the U.S. Open is a major golf event, which is tier 1
                          content. All stories have strong casual fan interest
                          and involve major stars or teams, justifying a top
                          score.

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes five stories with high relevance and star power. The trade of Rafael Devers is a major MLB event involving an All-Star player, which is highly relevant. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a significant NHL event. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals is crucial for fans following the series. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return to the Yankees is notable due to his star power. Finally, J.J. Spaun&#39;s victory at the U.S. Open is a major golf event, which is tier 1 content. All stories have strong casual fan interest and involve major stars or teams, justifying a top score.&quot;

                          The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack
                          major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open
                          victory by J.J. Spaun is a tier 1 story with high
                          relevance, but the other four stories are weak. The
                          Travelers Championship prediction, Duke freshmen
                          ranking, Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement, and
                          Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary are all low
                          in starpower and casual fan interest. With 4 weak
                          stories, the score must be -3 according to the
                          mandatory scoring rules.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a tier 1 story with high relevance, but the other four stories are weak. The Travelers Championship prediction, Duke freshmen ranking, Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement, and Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary are all low in starpower and casual fan interest. With 4 weak stories, the score must be -3 according to the mandatory scoring rules.&quot;

                          mandatory -3 score. The stories about PGA expert picks
                          (250), UFC commentary (240), SEC basketball opponents
                          (244), and an NFL coach&#39;s opinion on team defense
                          (243) are all considered weak due to low starpower and
                          casual fan interest. The MLB injury report (220) is
                          also weak as it lacks significant impact or starpower.
                          None of the stories feature major stars, teams, or
                          events that would appeal to a broad audience, and

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 4+ weak stories, triggering a mandatory -3 score. The stories about PGA expert picks (250), UFC commentary (240), SEC basketball opponents (244), and an NFL coach&#39;s opinion on team defense (243) are all considered weak due to low starpower and casual fan interest. The MLB injury report (220) is also weak as it lacks significant impact or starpower. None of the stories feature major stars, teams, or events that would appeal to a broad audience, and there are no tier 1 stories present.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and\n\&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in\nyour JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady,\n     Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British\n     Open winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major\n     wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins\n     exactly like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler\n     moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between\n     major tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis\n     (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly\n     niche sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**:\n\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with\n  multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak,\n  MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be\n  -3\n  - **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score\n  should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports\n  content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan\n  interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1\n  content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades,\n  championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions,\n  retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA\n  routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n\n- **3+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** → MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** → MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy\n  = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor\n  controversies involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis,\n  etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports\n  for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian\n  Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level\n  players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current\n  news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 4 stories with high starpower and casual fan interest: J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory (golf major), Rafael Devers&#39; trade (MLB All-Star trade), Panthers&#39; Stanley Cup win (NHL championship), and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals (NBA Finals context). The Giancarlo Stanton activation is less impactful but involves a major MLB star. Overall, the selection is strong with 4 tier 1 stories, justifying a score of +2.&quot;
