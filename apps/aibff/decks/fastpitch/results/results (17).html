A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

The Cardinals minicamp update (articleId 32) and the Southern Conference transfer portal story (articleId 48) are routine updates with minimal relevance to casual fans.

The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

The Chicago Sky story is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese's prominence, but the main news is about Courtney Vandersloot, who is not a household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with low international profile, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche. With at least three stories lacking starpower and two being minor/niche (college transfer and Boulter), this selection fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with only one or two redeeming stories.\"\n}","latencyMs":4439,"promptTokens":1776,"completionTokens":176,"totalTokens":1952,"totalCost":0.00496},{"id":"synthetic-1","grader_score":2,"truth_score":3,"notes":"Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, starpower), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event but Spaun himself lacks broad starpower; however, the U.S. Open is a top-tier golf event.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\\"id\\\",\\\"source_id\\\",\\\"title\\\",\\\"content\\\",\\\"url\\\",\\\"published_at\\\",\\\"scraped_at\\\",\\\"relevance_score\\\"\\n\\\"9\\\",\\\"7\\\",\\\"What do we really know about Michael Penix Jr.?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story is about a non-household name at a non-Grand Slam event, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a minor college baseball update.

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

This fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.","userMessage":"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\n254,\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\",\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\",50,\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\"\n253,\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\",\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\",70,\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\"\n252,\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\",\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\",80,\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\"\n251,\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\",\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\",60,\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\"\n250,\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\",\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\",60,\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes several high-profile stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win, while less prominent, still holds interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a golf story with less starpower prevents a perfect score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several high-profile stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win, while less prominent, still holds interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a golf story with less starpower prevents a perfect score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are niche or lack major stars. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun and the Travelers Championship prediction are golf-related and do not feature major stars, reducing their appeal to casual fans. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Michael Bisping's return for UFC commentary are also niche stories with limited starpower. Overall, the selection fails to include enough stories with major stars or broad interest, resulting in a below-average score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are niche or lack major stars. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun and the Travelers Championship prediction are golf-related and do not feature major stars, reducing their appeal to casual fans. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary are also niche stories with limited starpower. Overall, the selection fails to include enough stories with major stars or broad interest, resulting in a below-average score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert's pick, a UFC commentator's return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury update. None of these stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and they do not have significant casual fan interest. The selection includes multiple routine updates and niche sports stories, which do not generate widespread interest. The lack of high-profile stories results in a low overall relevance score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert&#39;s pick, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury update. None of these stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and they do not have significant casual fan interest. The selection includes multiple routine updates and niche sports stories, which do not generate widespread interest. The lack of high-profile stories results in a low overall relevance score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve prominent MLB players and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey, and Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals is highly relevant to basketball fans. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, involves a less prominent player, which slightly reduces the overall starpower. However, the selection overall is strong with four stories featuring major stars or teams and high casual fan interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve prominent MLB players and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey, and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals is highly relevant to basketball fans. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while notable, involves a less prominent player, which slightly reduces the overall starpower. However, the selection overall is strong with four stories featuring major stars or teams and high casual fan interest.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Three stories have strong starpower and broad interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big teams), Giancarlo Stanton's return (Yankees star), and the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event with major teams/players). The U.S. Open golf win by J.J. Spaun is a major event but Spaun himself is not a household name, so moderate starpower. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but naming the first six players is not a huge headline unless it includes major stars (not specified). Overall, the selection is solid but has notable weak spots in terms of starpower and casual fan appeal, especially with the golf and hockey stories.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with low international profile, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event but Spaun himself lacks broad starpower; however, the U.S. Open is a top-tier golf event. Overall, the selection is very strong with only a minor weak spot in individual starpower for the golf story.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, starpower), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event but Spaun himself lacks broad starpower; however, the U.S. Open is a top-tier golf event. Overall, the selection is very strong with only a minor weak spot in individual starpower for the golf story.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (with Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg) has strong starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, and the Travelers Championship pick is a niche gambling story about a non-star golfer. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche broadcasting note, not a major fight or star-driven storyline. With 3+ stories lacking starpower or broad appeal, this selection warrants a -2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (with Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg) has strong starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, and the Travelers Championship pick is a niche gambling story about a non-star golfer. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche broadcasting note, not a major fight or star-driven storyline. With 3+ stories lacking starpower or broad appeal, this selection warrants a -2.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship story focuses on Robert MacIntyre, who is not a household name. The UFC story is about a commentator (Michael Bisping) returning, not a major fight or star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a routine schedule update for a non-premier college basketball program. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach's opinion, not a major NFL star or dramatic development. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher who is not a superstar. At least three stories are low on starpower and broad appeal, triggering a harsh penalty.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship story focuses on Robert MacIntyre, who is not a household name. The UFC story is about a commentator (Michael Bisping) returning, not a major fight or star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a routine schedule update for a non-premier college basketball program. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach&#39;s opinion, not a major NFL star or dramatic development. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher who is not a superstar. At least three stories are low on starpower and broad appeal, triggering a harsh penalty.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars or prominent teams: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, huge franchise), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, starpower with back-to-back titles), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant sports event, but Spaun himself lacks major starpower, making this the weakest story in the group. However, the overall selection is strong, with only one notable weak spot, so it earns a +2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars or prominent teams: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, huge franchise), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, starpower with back-to-back titles), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant sports event, but Spaun himself lacks major starpower, making this the weakest story in the group. However, the overall selection is strong, with only one notable weak spot, so it earns a +2.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories is highly relevant and features major stars and teams. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a significant MLB event. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major NHL story. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals is crucial for basketball fans. Giancarlo Stanton's return to the Yankees is notable due to his star power. Finally, J.J. Spaun's victory at the U.S. Open is a Tier 1 golf event. All stories have high casual fan interest and timeliness, making this a top-tier selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes one Tier 1 story with J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, which is highly relevant due to its major status. However, the other stories lack significant starpower or broad appeal. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is low in starpower, as are the stories about Duke freshmen rankings, Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule, and Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary. The selection is dominated by routine or niche content with minimal household names, leading to a below-average relevance score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert pick, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams, and they do not have significant casual fan interest. The selection is dominated by routine and niche content with zero household names, which mandates a score of -3.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories is highly relevant and features major stars and teams. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a Tier 1 event with broad appeal. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a significant MLB story. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major NHL event. The injury status of Tyrese Haliburton is crucial for the NBA Finals, and Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable for MLB fans. All stories have high star power and casual fan interest, making this a top-tier selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

The fourth story, the U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement, is less star-driven and more administrative, but the Olympics and Team USA have broad interest. The weakest is the Stanton injury return, but the overall selection is strong, with 4+ stories of genuine starpower and interest.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles story, while involving a major name, is a trivial controversy rather than a substantive sports achievement, which should be penalized. The Chicago Sky story is about a WNBA injury, which, despite some rising stars, does not have broad household appeal. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story is about a non-household name at a non-Grand Slam event, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a minor college baseball update. At least three stories (minicamp, transfer portal, Boulter) are low starpower, and none are tier 1 content. This fits the criteria for a -2: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with few redeeming stories.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a tier 1 event. Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals is a major storyline involving a star player. Stanton's return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team's prominence. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content. This selection is exactly what sports fans would expect for top headlines.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events with strong casual fan interest. The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a tier 1 event. Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals is a major storyline involving a star player. Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team&#39;s prominence. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content. This selection is exactly what sports fans would expect for top headlines.&quot;

Spaun winning the U.S. Open (a golf major, which is always top-tier). The other four stories are weak: a PGA expert pick (routine, low starpower), a ranking of Duke freshmen (not current news, and only tangentially features stars), Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule (administrative, low interest), and a UFC commentator's return (not a star athlete or major event). This group is dominated by minor, routine, or administrative stories with little broad appeal, and only one household-name event. This fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains only one tier 1, high-starpower story: J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open (a golf major, which is always top-tier). The other four stories are weak: a PGA expert pick (routine, low starpower), a ranking of Duke freshmen (not current news, and only tangentially features stars), Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule (administrative, low interest), and a UFC commentator&#39;s return (not a star athlete or major event). This group is dominated by minor, routine, or administrative stories with little broad appeal, and only one household-name event. This fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.&quot;

The PGA expert pick is explicitly called out as low starpower and should be penalized. Michael Bisping's return to commentary is a niche, non-competitive UFC story. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine administrative update. Sean Payton's comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos' defense is a minor personnel/strategy note, not a headline story. The Astros' injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is a routine injury report. There are zero household names in major, high-stakes events, and the selection is dominated by the exact type of content that triggers a mandatory -3: expert picks, commentator news, schedules, and injury reports.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are routine, low-starpower, or administrative updates with little to no broad appeal. The PGA expert pick is explicitly called out as low starpower and should be penalized. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is a niche, non-competitive UFC story. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine administrative update. Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos&#39; defense is a minor personnel/strategy note, not a headline story. The Astros&#39; injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is a routine injury report. There are zero household names in major, high-stakes events, and the selection is dominated by the exact type of content that triggers a mandatory -3: expert picks, commentator news, schedules, and injury reports.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events with strong casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win is a golf major (tier 1 content), the Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star, the Panthers' Stanley Cup win is a major NHL event, Haliburton's injury status is crucial to the NBA Finals, and Stanton's return involves a Yankees superstar. This selection is exactly what sports fans would expect for top headlines.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)&quot;
