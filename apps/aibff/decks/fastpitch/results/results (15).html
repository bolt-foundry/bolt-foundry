A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

The Simone Biles story is the only one with true major starpower and broad appeal. The Chicago Sky story is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese's prominence, but the main news is about Courtney Vandersloot, who is not a household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with little international recognition, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche. With at least three stories lacking starpower and two being minor/niche (college transfer and Boulter), this selection fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with only one or two redeeming stories.\"\n}","latencyMs":6020,"promptTokens":1776,"completionTokens":177,"totalTokens":1953,"totalCost":0.004968},{"id":"synthetic-1","grader_score":2,"truth_score":3,"notes":"Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events: (1) Rafael Devers trade (All-Star, Red Sox, Giants‚Äîmajor MLB teams and a blockbuster move), (2) Panthers win Stanley Cup (championship, major NHL event), (3) Tyrese Haliburton injury status for NBA Finals Game 6 (star player, NBA Finals), and (4) Giancarlo Stanton returns for Yankees (superstar, Yankees are a marquee franchise). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event (a golf major), but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the event itself is significant and has broad interest.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no major stars or drama. Sean Payton/Bo Nix is a story about a rookie QB and a rebuilding team, not a headline-grabbing franchise or player. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a pitcher who is not a major star. At least three stories (Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary, McCullers injury) have minimal starpower and little casual fan interest, triggering a harsh penalty.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\\"id\\\",\\\"source_id\\\",\\\"title\\\",\\\"content\\\",\\\"url\\\",\\\"published_at\\\",\\\"scraped_at\\\",\\\"relevance_score\\\"\\n\\\"9\\\",\\\"7\\\",\\\"What do we really know about Michael Penix Jr.?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

The Simone Biles story features a major star, but the content is a trivial controversy rather than a substantive sports achievement, which should be penalized. The Chicago Sky story involves a WNBA team and a notable player injury, but WNBA has limited mainstream starpower outside of a few household names, and Courtney Vandersloot is not a widely recognized star. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine update about players taking it easy, lacking both starpower and interest. The Katie Boulter tennis story is about a non-household name winning an early-round match at a non-major tournament, which is niche. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a classic example of a minor college update with no broad appeal. With at least three stories (minicamp, Boulter, transfer portal) lacking starpower and two others (Biles apology, WNBA injury) being either trivial or low-tier, this selection fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.\"\n}","latencyMs":6212,"promptTokens":2072,"completionTokens":240,"totalTokens":2312,"totalCost":0.006064},{"id":"synthetic-1","grader_score":3,"truth_score":3,"notes":"All five stories feature major stars, teams, or events with high casual fan interest.

Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team's prominence. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a Tier 1 golf major, which always has broad appeal.

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major story with high relevance. Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun, while not featuring a major star, is a significant event in golf. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly relevant, though the teams are not the most prominent.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The Katie Boulter story (articleId 38) involves a moderate-level tennis player with limited appeal. Overall, the selection lacks prominent stars and fails to capture broad interest, with multiple stories being niche or routine updates.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes several high-profile stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while less prominent, still holds interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a golf story with less starpower prevents a perfect score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve the Yankees and Red Sox, teams with large fanbases. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and relevant to major sports events. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while less prominent, still holds interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a golf story with less starpower prevents a perfect score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are niche or lack major stars. The golf stories focus on less prominent players like J.J. Spaun and Robert MacIntyre, which do not have widespread appeal. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement and Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary are also niche stories with limited interest to casual fans. Overall, the selection fails to include enough stories with major stars or high casual fan interest, resulting in a below-average score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are niche or lack major stars. The golf stories focus on less prominent players like J.J. Spaun and Robert MacIntyre, which do not have widespread appeal. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement and Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary are also niche stories with limited interest to casual fans. Overall, the selection fails to include enough stories with major stars or high casual fan interest, resulting in a below-average score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert&#39;s pick, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and they lack significant casual fan interest. The selection includes multiple routine updates and niche sports stories, which do not generate widespread interest. The absence of high-profile athletes or teams results in a low overall relevance score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton involve prominent MLB players and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and involve high-profile events. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a less prominent golf story slightly weakens the selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton involve prominent MLB players and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and involve high-profile events. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a less prominent golf story slightly weakens the selection.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Three stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big teams), Giancarlo Stanton's return (Yankees star), and the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event with major teams/players). The U.S. Open golf win is a major event, but J.J. Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but naming only six players (and likely not major stars yet) is less compelling. Overall, the selection is decent but has notable weak spots in terms of starpower and casual fan interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The Simone Biles story is the only one with true major starpower and broad appeal. The Chicago Sky story is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese's prominence, but the main news is about Courtney Vandersloot, who is not a household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars or drama. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with little international recognition, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche. With at least three stories lacking starpower and two being minor/niche (college transfer and Boulter), this selection fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with only one or two redeeming stories.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event (a golf major), but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the event itself is significant and has broad interest. Overall, this is a strong selection with only a minor weak spot.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events: (1) Rafael Devers trade (All-Star, Red Sox, Giants‚Äîmajor MLB teams and a blockbuster move), (2) Panthers win Stanley Cup (championship, major NHL event), (3) Tyrese Haliburton injury status for NBA Finals Game 6 (star player, NBA Finals), and (4) Giancarlo Stanton returns for Yankees (superstar, Yankees are a marquee franchise). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event (a golf major), but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the event itself is significant and has broad interest. Overall, this is a strong selection with only a minor weak spot.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (254) has strong starpower and broad appeal due to names like Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun (218) is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name, so the starpower is moderate at best. The Travelers Championship pick (250) is a niche gambling/preview story about Robert MacIntyre, who lacks broad recognition. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement (244) is a routine college basketball schedule update with little relevance to most fans. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return (240) is a minor broadcast note, not a major sports headline. There are at least three stories (250, 244, 240) with minimal starpower and little broad appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (254) has strong starpower and broad appeal due to names like Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun (218) is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name, so the starpower is moderate at best. The Travelers Championship pick (250) is a niche gambling/preview story about Robert MacIntyre, who lacks broad recognition. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement (244) is a routine college basketball schedule update with little relevance to most fans. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return (240) is a minor broadcast note, not a major sports headline. There are at least three stories (250, 244, 240) with minimal starpower and little broad appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains mostly minor or niche stories with little broad appeal. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks starpower, as MacIntyre is not a household name. Michael Bisping's return to commentary is a niche UFC broadcast update, not a major fight or star-driven story. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no major stars or drama. Sean Payton/Bo Nix is a story about a rookie QB and a rebuilding team, not a headline-grabbing franchise or player. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a pitcher who is not a major star. At least three stories (Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary, McCullers injury) have minimal starpower and little casual fan interest, triggering a harsh penalty. None of the stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or high-profile teams in dramatic situations.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains mostly minor or niche stories with little broad appeal. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks starpower, as MacIntyre is not a household name. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is a niche UFC broadcast update, not a major fight or star-driven story. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no major stars or drama. Sean Payton/Bo Nix is a story about a rookie QB and a rebuilding team, not a headline-grabbing franchise or player. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a pitcher who is not a major star. At least three stories (Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary, McCullers injury) have minimal starpower and little casual fan interest, triggering a harsh penalty. None of the stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or high-profile teams in dramatic situations.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, NHL stars), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event itself is significant. Overall, the selection is highly relevant for sports fans, with only one story lacking top-tier starpower.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, NHL stars), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event itself is significant. Overall, the selection is highly relevant for sports fans, with only one story lacking top-tier starpower.&quot;

The trade of All-Star Rafael Devers is a significant move involving a prominent player and team, appealing to both dedicated and casual fans. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory is a major golf event, which is highly relevant. Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable due to his status as a well-known player for the Yankees, a prominent team. However, the story about the U.S. hockey roster for the 2026 Olympics and the NBA Finals game preview are less impactful in terms of immediate starpower and casual fan interest. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, justifying a score of +2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with high starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of All-Star Rafael Devers is a significant move involving a prominent player and team, appealing to both dedicated and casual fans. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory is a major golf event, which is highly relevant. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is notable due to his status as a well-known player for the Yankees, a prominent team. However, the story about the U.S. hockey roster for the 2026 Olympics and the NBA Finals game preview are less impactful in terms of immediate starpower and casual fan interest. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, justifying a score of +2.&quot;

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection is dominated by stories with low starpower and minimal casual fan interest. The inclusion of a college transfer portal story and a routine minicamp update significantly detracts from the overall relevance. Simone Biles&#39; apology, while involving a major star, is a trivial story that does not add substantive value. The tennis and WNBA stories lack household names and broad appeal. Overall, the selection fails to feature major stars or teams and is filled with routine updates and niche content, warranting a -3 score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of relevance. The story about J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is highly relevant due to the major starpower of a golf major victory. However, the inclusion of a PGA expert prediction for the Travelers Championship significantly lowers the starpower, as it is a routine prediction without broad appeal. The Duke freshmen ranking has some interest due to Zion Williamson's inclusion, but it is not a current event. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement and Michael Bisping's return for UFC commentary are both low in starpower and casual fan interest. Overall, the selection has notable weak spots with multiple stories lacking significant starpower or broad appeal.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of relevance. The story about J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is highly relevant due to the major starpower of a golf major victory. However, the inclusion of a PGA expert prediction for the Travelers Championship significantly lowers the starpower, as it is a routine prediction without broad appeal. The Duke freshmen ranking has some interest due to Zion Williamson&#39;s inclusion, but it is not a current event. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement and Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary are both low in starpower and casual fan interest. Overall, the selection has notable weak spots with multiple stories lacking significant starpower or broad appeal.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert prediction, which is low starpower, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a speculative NFL story about a college player, and an MLB injury update. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest among casual sports fans. Additionally, the selection is dominated by routine updates and niche content, which further diminishes its relevance.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes several stories with high player starpower and team prominence. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, which is tier 1 content. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is significant in MLB. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is relevant due to the NBA Finals context, and Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. However, the inclusion of an injury update and a player activation story slightly reduces the overall casual fan interest, preventing a perfect score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with high player starpower and team prominence. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, which is tier 1 content. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is significant in MLB. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is relevant due to the NBA Finals context, and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. However, the inclusion of an injury update and a player activation story slightly reduces the overall casual fan interest, preventing a perfect score.&quot;

The NBA Finals story would be highly relevant, but it appears to be fabricated or not present in the source articles, so it cannot be credited. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely but lacks starpower unless it features major NHL names, which is not specified.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

The Chicago Sky story involves a WNBA team and a notable player injury, but WNBA has limited mainstream starpower outside of a few household names, and Courtney Vandersloot is not a widely recognized star. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine update about players taking it easy, lacking both starpower and interest. The Katie Boulter tennis story is about a non-household name winning an early-round match at a non-major tournament, which is niche. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a classic example of a minor college update with no broad appeal. With at least three stories (minicamp, Boulter, transfer portal) lacking starpower and two others (Biles apology, WNBA injury) being either trivial or low-tier, this selection fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving a household name and two prominent MLB teams (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is highly relevant as it impacts the NBA Finals, a marquee event. Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team's prominence. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a Tier 1 golf major, which always has broad appeal. All stories are timely, involve major leagues, and would interest casual fans. No weak or niche stories are present.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five stories feature major stars, teams, or events with high casual fan interest. The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving a household name and two prominent MLB teams (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is highly relevant as it impacts the NBA Finals, a marquee event. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is notable due to his starpower and the team&#39;s prominence. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a Tier 1 golf major, which always has broad appeal. All stories are timely, involve major leagues, and would interest casual fans. No weak or niche stories are present.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a tier 1, high-relevance story. However, the PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is a routine prediction and should be penalized for low starpower. The Duke freshmen ranking has some interest due to Zion Williamson and the Duke brand, but is not a major news story. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement is a routine schedule update with little broad appeal. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche, non-competitive story. With 3+ stories lacking starpower or broad interest (PGA expert pick, SEC schedule, Bisping commentary), this selection is dominated by minor/niche content and deserves a -2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a tier 1, high-relevance story. However, the PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is a routine prediction and should be penalized for low starpower. The Duke freshmen ranking has some interest due to Zion Williamson and the Duke brand, but is not a major news story. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement is a routine schedule update with little broad appeal. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche, non-competitive story. With 3+ stories lacking starpower or broad interest (PGA expert pick, SEC schedule, Bisping commentary), this selection is dominated by minor/niche content and deserves a -2.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection is dominated by routine updates and stories with low starpower. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is specifically called out as low starpower and should be penalized. Michael Bisping returning to commentary is a niche UFC broadcast update, not a major fight or star-driven storyline. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no starpower. Sean Payton's comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos' defense is a minor NFL personnel/development story, not a headline involving a superstar or major team move. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine MLB injury update about a non-household name. None of these stories feature major stars, high-profile teams, or high casual fan interest. This selection fits the instant negative triggers: 4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names, and is dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, and injury reports.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection is dominated by routine updates and stories with low starpower. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is specifically called out as low starpower and should be penalized. Michael Bisping returning to commentary is a niche UFC broadcast update, not a major fight or star-driven storyline. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with no starpower. Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos&#39; defense is a minor NFL personnel/development story, not a headline involving a superstar or major team move. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine MLB injury update about a non-household name. None of these stories feature major stars, high-profile teams, or high casual fan interest. This selection fits the instant negative triggers: 4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names, and is dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, and injury reports.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All five stories feature major stars, teams, or events with high casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win is a golf major (tier 1), the Red Sox trading Rafael Devers is a blockbuster MLB move involving a household name, the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major team accomplishment, Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is highly relevant during the NBA Finals, and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees is a notable event for a prominent team and star. Each story is timely, features high starpower, and would interest casual fans. There are no weak or niche stories in the selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have high starpower and broad appeal\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **Use -3 when selection is dominated by routine updates, niche sports, and non-stars**\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí automatic -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí automatic -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **Note**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content&quot;
