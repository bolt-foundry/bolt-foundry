A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

The David Ortiz and Rafael Devers trade story involves a prominent MLB team and a well-known former player, adding casual fan interest. The NFL 25-year best roster story features major stars like Tom Brady, appealing to a broad audience.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars mentioned.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

The WNBA Commissioner's Cup story is the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus and is more niche, but the league's rising profile and the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it from being irrelevant.

The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event itself is significant.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Sean Payton/Bo Nix/Broncos is only moderately interesting, as Bo Nix is not a household name and the Broncos are not a top-tier franchise. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a non-superstar.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

The NBA Finals story (Haliburton injury) is highly timely and relevant featuring a star player in a championship series. The NHL Olympic roster announcement has good starpower with Matthews and the Tkachuk brothers. The Rafael Devers trade commentary from David Ortiz combines a Hall of Famer's perspective with a significant MLB transaction. The NFL 25-year roster piece has broad appeal to casual fans with nostalgic content about superstars. The WNBA Commissioner's Cup story is the weakest link (less starpower and casual fan interest), but still covers a growing league's special event. The selection avoids common pitfalls like minor college sports, routine updates, or niche sports, while maintaining good timeliness across all stories. Four of the five stories have genuine starpower and prominence, with only the WNBA piece being somewhat weaker in broad appeal.\"\n}\n```","latencyMs":6859,"promptTokens":1962,"completionTokens":226,"totalTokens":2188,"totalCost":0.009276},{"id":"synthetic-1","grader_score":0,"truth_score":3,"notes":"Failed to parse grader response: ```json\n{\n  \"score\": 2,\n  \"reason\": \"This selection features strong starpower and relevance across a...","userMessage":"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\n254,\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\",\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\",50,\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\"\n253,\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\",\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\",70,\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\"\n252,\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\",\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\",80,\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\"\n251,\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\",\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\",60,\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\"\n250,\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\",\"CBS Sports\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/\",\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\",\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\",\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\",60,\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The Rafael Devers trade (major MLB All-Star) is breaking news with a star player. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a championship-deciding moment. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status directly impacts the NBA Finals. Giancarlo Stanton is a Yankees superstar returning from injury. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is timely major championship news. All stories have high casual fan interest with clear narratives (blockbuster trade, championship win, finals injury drama, star player return, major golf championship). The selection represents multiple sports (baseball, hockey, basketball, golf) with appropriate balance. The only minor weakness is that Spaun isn't a household name in golf, but winning a major championship justifies his inclusion. Overall, this is a very strong, well-balanced selection of the most relevant sports stories.\"\n}\n```","graderMetadata":{"verbosePrompt":"{\n  \"model\": \"anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"system\",\n      \"content\": \"# Sports Relevance Grader\\n\\n# Grader Base Deck\\n\\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect.

Tyrese Haliburton's injury status directly impacts the NBA Finals. Giancarlo Stanton is a Yankees superstar returning from injury. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is timely major championship news. All stories have high casual fan interest with clear narratives (blockbuster trade, championship win, finals injury drama, star player return, major golf championship). The selection represents multiple sports (baseball, hockey, basketball, golf) with appropriate balance. The only minor weakness is that Spaun isn't a household name in golf, but winning a major championship justifies his inclusion.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The Yankees (Stanton) and Red Sox (Devers) are marquee franchises. The U.S. Open golf major championship, while featuring a less prominent winner in Spaun, still represents a major championship that casual fans would discuss. The selection balances different sports (NBA, NHL, MLB, golf) while focusing on championship-level events and star players. The only minor weakness is that Spaun isn't a household name, but winning a major makes this newsworthy regardless.

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles.

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list -

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"\\\"id\\\",\\\"source_id\\\",\\\"title\\\",\\\"content\\\",\\\"url\\\",\\\"published_at\\\",\\\"scraped_at\\\",\\\"relevance_score\\\"\\n\\\"9\\\",\\\"7\\\",\\\"What do we really know about Michael Penix Jr.?

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles.

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major story with high relevance. Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun, while not featuring a major star, is a significant event in golf. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly relevant, though the teams are not the most prominent.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The story about Simone Biles (a major star) is relevant, but the others lack significant prominence. The Chicago Sky story involves a WNBA team, which has less mainstream appeal compared to major men's sports leagues. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine update with no major stars highlighted. The Katie Boulter tennis story and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story both involve niche or lower-tier athletes.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and interest. The Tyrese Haliburton injury story is timely and relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, featuring a prominent player. The US Hockey story includes major stars like Auston Matthews, appealing to fans of international sports. The David Ortiz and Rafael Devers trade story involves a prominent MLB team and a well-known former player, adding casual fan interest. The NFL 25-year best roster story features major stars like Tom Brady, appealing to a broad audience. However, the WNBA story, while interesting, lacks the same level of starpower and broad appeal as the others. Overall, 3 stories have decent relevance, but the selection has notable weak spots, particularly with the WNBA story's limited starpower.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The trade of Rafael Devers, a major MLB All-Star, to the Giants is a blockbuster deal that would interest many fans. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is crucial for the NBA Finals, involving a prominent player. Giancarlo Stanton's return to the Yankees is notable due to his star status. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory adds a dramatic storyline from golf. While all stories have relevance, the selection could be stronger if it included more Tier 1 stars or more universally appealing stories. However, the selection is still strong overall with 4 out of 5 stories having significant starpower and interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several high-profile stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, a major MLB All-Star, to the Giants is a blockbuster deal that would interest many fans. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is crucial for the NBA Finals, involving a prominent player. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return to the Yankees is notable due to his star status. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory adds a dramatic storyline from golf. While all stories have relevance, the selection could be stronger if it included more Tier 1 stars or more universally appealing stories. However, the selection is still strong overall with 4 out of 5 stories having significant starpower and interest.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke's top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star with widespread interest. The other stories focus on niche topics or less prominent figures, such as J.J. Spaun's golf victory and Robert MacIntyre's PGA predictions, which do not have high casual fan interest. The inclusion of a story about Oklahoma's SEC basketball opponents and Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary further diminishes the selection's relevance. Overall, the selection fails to highlight major stars or teams and lacks stories with strong casual fan interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke&#39;s top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star with widespread interest. The other stories focus on niche topics or less prominent figures, such as J.J. Spaun&#39;s golf victory and Robert MacIntyre&#39;s PGA predictions, which do not have high casual fan interest. The inclusion of a story about Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents and Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary further diminishes the selection&#39;s relevance. Overall, the selection fails to highlight major stars or teams and lacks stories with strong casual fan interest.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert backing a golfer, a UFC commentator returning, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest. Additionally, there are two routine injury/personnel updates, which automatically warrant a penalty. Overall, the selection is below average in terms of relevance for casual sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert backing a golfer, a UFC commentator returning, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest. Additionally, there are two routine injury/personnel updates, which automatically warrant a penalty. Overall, the selection is below average in terms of relevance for casual sports fans.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve major MLB stars and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are also high-interest stories involving prominent teams and players. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, the selection is strong but not perfect, as it includes one story with moderate starpower.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve major MLB stars and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are also high-interest stories involving prominent teams and players. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, the selection is strong but not perfect, as it includes one story with moderate starpower.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Three stories have strong starpower and broad interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big teams), Giancarlo Stanton's return (Yankees star), and the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event with major teams/players). The U.S. Open golf win is a major event, but J.J. Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but naming the first six players (unless they are superstars) is not a huge headline. Overall, the selection is decent but has notable weak spots in terms of starpower and casual fan appeal.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

The Simone Biles story is the only one with true major starpower and broad appeal. The Chicago Sky story is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese's prominence, but the main news is about Courtney Vandersloot, who is not a household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars mentioned. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with low international profile, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche. With at least three stories lacking starpower and broad appeal, this selection warrants a -2 score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: Haliburton's injury in the NBA Finals (major star, high stakes), US Hockey Olympic roster (features Matthews and Tkachuk brothers, big names), David Ortiz commenting on a Red Sox trade (Ortiz is a legend, Devers is a star, Red Sox are a major franchise), and the NFL all-time 25-year team (features superstars like Brady, Moss, etc., and is a fun topic for all fans). The WNBA Commissioner's Cup story is the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus and is more niche, but the league's rising profile and the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it from being irrelevant. Overall, this is a strong, timely, and relevant selection with only one notable weak spot.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features stars and a major event), Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Stanton's return for the Yankees (household name, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event itself is significant. Overall, the selection is highly relevant for sports fans, with only one story lacking a true superstar, so it earns a +2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features stars and a major event), Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (household name, iconic team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, making this the weakest of the five. However, the event itself is significant. Overall, the selection is highly relevant for sports fans, with only one story lacking a true superstar, so it earns a +2.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant golf event, but Spaun is not a household name, and the Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche betting story about a non-star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche broadcasting note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (Travelers pick, Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant golf event, but Spaun is not a household name, and the Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche betting story about a non-star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a niche broadcasting note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (Travelers pick, Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche golf story without a major star. Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is not a headline event for most sports fans. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with little national appeal. Sean Payton/Bo Nix/Broncos is only moderately interesting, as Bo Nix is not a household name and the Broncos are not a top-tier franchise. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a non-superstar. There are no major stars, breaking news, or high-drama stories here, and at least three stories are minor/niche. This fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche golf story without a major star. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is not a headline event for most sports fans. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with little national appeal. Sean Payton/Bo Nix/Broncos is only moderately interesting, as Bo Nix is not a household name and the Broncos are not a top-tier franchise. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a non-superstar. There are no major stars, breaking news, or high-drama stories here, and at least three stories are minor/niche. This fits the -2 criteria: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars or teams: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (blockbuster MLB trade involving a prominent player and franchise), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (major NHL event), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player in a championship series), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (household name on a marquee team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant sports event, but Spaun himself lacks major starpower, making this the weakest of the five. However, the overall selection is strong, with only one story lacking broad star/casual fan appeal, so this earns a +2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars or teams: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (blockbuster MLB trade involving a prominent player and franchise), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (major NHL event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player in a championship series), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (household name on a marquee team). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant sports event, but Spaun himself lacks major starpower, making this the weakest of the five. However, the overall selection is strong, with only one story lacking broad star/casual fan appeal, so this earns a +2.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

{
  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection has some strengths but notable weaknesses. Looking at each story: 1) Devers trade is strong - involves an All-Star player and major market teams (Red Sox/Giants). 2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is timely and a major championship, but Spaun is not a household name (Tier 3-4 starpower). 3) Pacers-Thunder NBA Finals is excellent (high starpower, casual fan interest). 4) U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement has moderate appeal but lacks specific star names and is less timely. 5) Stanton return is decent (Tier 2 star on Yankees). Overall, only 2-3 stories have genuine starpower/prominence. The selection misses stronger options like the Michael Penix Jr. NFL story (higher casual fan interest). The selection has some good stories but doesn&#39;t consistently deliver high-relevance content across all 5 picks.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection has significant weaknesses with multiple stories lacking starpower and broad appeal. Breaking down the 5 stories: (1) Simone Biles story has excellent starpower (Tier 1) and cultural relevance; (2) Chicago Sky/WNBA injury news has moderate appeal with Angel Reese mentioned but focuses on Vandersloot&#39;s injury - a routine personnel update; (3) Cardinals minicamp workload story is a minor NFL update with minimal interest to casual fans; (4) Katie Boulter at Queen&#39;s is a niche tennis story about a non-household name; (5) Southern Conference college baseball transfer portal news has virtually no starpower or casual fan interest. The selection includes 2+ routine injury/personnel updates and 3+ stories with minimal starpower, triggering automatic penalties. Only the Simone Biles story has genuine broad appeal, while the rest would be of limited interest to casual sports fans.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

{
  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection is strong overall with good diversity across major sports. The NBA Finals story (Haliburton injury) is highly timely and relevant featuring a star player in a championship series. The NHL Olympic roster announcement has good starpower with Matthews and the Tkachuk brothers. The Rafael Devers trade commentary from David Ortiz combines a Hall of Famer&#39;s perspective with a significant MLB transaction. The NFL 25-year roster piece has broad appeal to casual fans with nostalgic content about superstars. The WNBA Commissioner&#39;s Cup story is the weakest link (less starpower and casual fan interest), but still covers a growing league&#39;s special event. The selection avoids common pitfalls like minor college sports, routine updates, or niche sports, while maintaining good timeliness across all stories. Four of the five stories have genuine starpower and prominence, with only the WNBA piece being somewhat weaker in broad appeal.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

{
  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection features strong starpower and relevance across all 5 stories. The Rafael Devers trade (major MLB All-Star) is breaking news with a star player. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a championship-deciding moment. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status directly impacts the NBA Finals. Giancarlo Stanton is a Yankees superstar returning from injury. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is timely major championship news. All stories have high casual fan interest with clear narratives (blockbuster trade, championship win, finals injury drama, star player return, major golf championship). The selection represents multiple sports (baseball, hockey, basketball, golf) with appropriate balance. The only minor weakness is that Spaun isn&#39;t a household name in golf, but winning a major championship justifies his inclusion. Overall, this is a very strong, well-balanced selection of the most relevant sports stories.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection shows extremely poor judgment in identifying relevant sports stories. None of the 5 stories feature major stars or teams with broad appeal to casual fans. The selection includes: (1) J.J. Spaun (a low-tier golfer) winning the US Open - while this is a major tournament, Spaun lacks starpower; (2) A betting prediction for Robert MacIntyre (another low-profile golfer); (3) A college basketball ranking article about Duke freshmen; (4) Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement (pure administrative news); (5) UFC commentary booth personnel news about Michael Bisping. The selection completely ignores available high-profile stories about NBA Finals (Pacers-Thunder, Haliburton injury), Stanley Cup Finals (Panthers), MLB stars (Giancarlo Stanton, Rafael Devers trade), and Caitlin Clark/WNBA news. This selection features multiple minor college stories, routine personnel updates, and completely lacks any major star power throughout, hitting all the penalty criteria.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection is extremely poor, featuring almost entirely low-relevance stories with minimal starpower and little casual fan interest. The selection includes: (1) A golf tournament preview about Robert MacIntyre, a non-household name; (2) UFC commentary booth news about Michael Bisping, which is purely production information; (3) Oklahoma basketball&#39;s SEC schedule announcement, a minor college administrative update; (4) Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix, a rookie quarterback and defense-building; and (5) Lance McCullers Jr.&#39;s injury, a routine IL placement for a non-star pitcher. The selection completely ignores major available stories like the NBA Finals (Haliburton injury for Game 6), Stanley Cup Finals (Panthers winning), Yankees star Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return, and the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers. This selection features multiple routine injury/personnel updates, multiple minor college stories, and zero stories with significant starpower, triggering multiple automatic penalties.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection features strong starpower and relevance across all 5 stories. The NBA Finals (Haliburton/Pacers vs. Thunder), Stanley Cup Finals (Panthers winning), and major MLB trades/returns (Devers trade, Stanton return) all represent high-profile, timely stories with prominent teams and players. The Yankees (Stanton) and Red Sox (Devers) are marquee franchises. The U.S. Open golf major championship, while featuring a less prominent winner in Spaun, still represents a major championship that casual fans would discuss. The selection balances different sports (NBA, NHL, MLB, golf) while focusing on championship-level events and star players. The only minor weakness is that Spaun isn&#39;t a household name, but winning a major makes this newsworthy regardless. Overall, this is a very strong, well-balanced selection that casual sports fans would find relevant and interesting.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 4 stories with genuine starpower and strong interest: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, the NBA Finals Game 5, and the U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement. These stories feature major stars, prominent teams, and events with high casual fan interest. The story about Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return from injury is less impactful but does involve a well-known player. Overall, the selection is strong with 4 tier 1 stories, justifying a score of +2.&quot;

The stories about the Cardinals' minicamp (32), a college pitcher entering the transfer portal (48), and Katie Boulter's win at a non-major tennis event (38) are all considered weak due to their low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles apology (36) is a trivial celebrity controversy, and the WNBA injury report (42) lacks the prominence needed to elevate the selection. With 4+ weak stories, the score must be -3 according to the mandatory scoring rules.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack major starpower or broad appeal. The stories about the Cardinals&#39; minicamp (32), a college pitcher entering the transfer portal (48), and Katie Boulter&#39;s win at a non-major tennis event (38) are all considered weak due to their low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles apology (36) is a trivial celebrity controversy, and the WNBA injury report (42) lacks the prominence needed to elevate the selection. With 4+ weak stories, the score must be -3 according to the mandatory scoring rules.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of relevance. The Tyrese Haliburton injury update is highly relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, a major event. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement is also significant, featuring star players like Matthews and the Tkachuk brothers, which holds cross-sport appeal. However, the David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade lacks substantive news value, as it is more of a reaction piece. The NFL retrospective list, while interesting, does not provide current news value. The WNBA story, despite being about an in-season tournament, does not feature major stars or historic moments, reducing its relevance. Overall, only 2 stories have genuine starpower and interest, while 3 are weaker, leading to a score of -1.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of relevance. The Tyrese Haliburton injury update is highly relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, a major event. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement is also significant, featuring star players like Matthews and the Tkachuk brothers, which holds cross-sport appeal. However, the David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade lacks substantive news value, as it is more of a reaction piece. The NFL retrospective list, while interesting, does not provide current news value. The WNBA story, despite being about an in-season tournament, does not feature major stars or historic moments, reducing its relevance. Overall, only 2 stories have genuine starpower and interest, while 3 are weaker, leading to a score of -1.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack major starpower or broad appeal. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a tier 1 story with high relevance, but the other stories are weak: a PGA expert prediction (low starpower), a retrospective ranking of Duke freshmen (low casual fan interest), an announcement of SEC basketball opponents (routine content), and a UFC commentary update (low starpower). With 4 weak stories, the selection must be scored as -3.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack major starpower or broad appeal. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a tier 1 story with high relevance, but the other stories are weak: a PGA expert prediction (low starpower), a retrospective ranking of Duke freshmen (low casual fan interest), an announcement of SEC basketball opponents (routine content), and a UFC commentary update (low starpower). With 4 weak stories, the selection must be scored as -3.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 5 stories, all of which are weak in terms of player starpower and team prominence. The stories cover routine content such as expert predictions for a non-major golf event, a commentator&#39;s return for a UFC event, a college basketball schedule announcement, a coach&#39;s opinion on a team&#39;s defense, and an injury report for a non-playoff MLB game. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams, nor do they have significant casual fan interest or timeliness. This selection fits the criteria for a -3 score, as all stories are weak and lack relevance for sports fans.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 4 stories with high starpower and relevance: J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory (a major golf event), Rafael Devers&#39; trade (a major MLB transaction), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (a major NHL event), and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals (a high-stakes NBA context). The story about Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return from injury is less impactful but involves a prominent player from a major team. Overall, the selection is strong with 4 tier 1 stories, justifying a score of +2.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories are tier 1 or have strong starpower and broad interest: (1) The Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers is a major MLB move involving a prominent team and star player; (2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content; (3) NBA Finals Game 5 is a top-tier event with high casual fan interest; (4) U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcements can be tier 1 if major stars are named, though the summary doesn't specify, but the Olympics generally have broad appeal. The only weaker story is Giancarlo Stanton's injury return, which, while involving a star, is a routine update. Therefore, this selection fits the +2 criteria: 4+ stories with genuine starpower/prominence and strong interest.</div>

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are tier 1 or have strong starpower and broad interest: (1) The Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers is a major MLB move involving a prominent team and star player; (2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content; (3) NBA Finals Game 5 is a top-tier event with high casual fan interest; (4) U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcements can be tier 1 if major stars are named, though the summary doesn&#39;t specify, but the Olympics generally have broad appeal. The only weaker story is Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s injury return, which, while involving a star, is a routine update. Therefore, this selection fits the +2 criteria: 4+ stories with genuine starpower/prominence and strong interest.&quot;

The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel/injury management story. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a non-household name in a non-major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year entering the transfer portal is a minor college move. With 5 weak stories, the mandatory score is -3.</div>

Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are weak according to the grading criteria. The Simone Biles story is a minor controversy, not a substantive sports achievement. The Chicago Sky story is a WNBA injury report, which is routine and not about a major star or historic moment. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel/injury management story. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a non-household name in a non-major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year entering the transfer portal is a minor college move. With 5 weak stories, the mandatory score is -3.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Let's count the weak stories: (1) The Haliburton injury update is only relevant if it's a Finals injury for a major star, but the Pacers and Haliburton are not at the LeBron/Curry level, so this is borderline but not tier 1. (2) US Hockey Olympic roster announcement includes major NHL stars (Matthews, Tkachuk), so this is strong. (3) David Ortiz commenting on a Red Sox trade is a reaction piece, not a major event‚Äîthis is weak. (4) The NFL all-time 25-year roster is a retrospective list, not current news‚Äîthis is weak. (5) WNBA Commissioner's Cup group play is routine WNBA content, not a major star or historic moment‚Äîthis is weak. That makes 3 weak stories (Ortiz reaction, NFL retrospective, WNBA routine), so by the rules, this is a mandatory -2. There is some redeeming content (Olympic roster, borderline NBA Finals injury), but the majority is weak or routine.</div>

If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Let&#39;s count the weak stories: (1) The Haliburton injury update is only relevant if it&#39;s a Finals injury for a major star, but the Pacers and Haliburton are not at the LeBron/Curry level, so this is borderline but not tier 1. (2) US Hockey Olympic roster announcement includes major NHL stars (Matthews, Tkachuk), so this is strong. (3) David Ortiz commenting on a Red Sox trade is a reaction piece, not a major event‚Äîthis is weak. (4) The NFL all-time 25-year roster is a retrospective list, not current news‚Äîthis is weak. (5) WNBA Commissioner&#39;s Cup group play is routine WNBA content, not a major star or historic moment‚Äîthis is weak. That makes 3 weak stories (Ortiz reaction, NFL retrospective, WNBA routine), so by the rules, this is a mandatory -2. There is some redeeming content (Olympic roster, borderline NBA Finals injury), but the majority is weak or routine.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events with strong casual fan interest. The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a tier 1 championship event. Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals is a major storyline involving a star player in a championship series. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is a significant update involving a household name and a marquee team. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a golf major, which is always tier 1 content. All stories are timely, involve major sports, and would be of high interest to sports fans.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five selected stories are weak by the grading criteria: (1) PGA expert picks for the Travelers Championship is low starpower and not a major event; (2) Ranking Duke freshmen is a retrospective list, not current news or tier 1 content; (3) Oklahoma announcing SEC basketball opponents is a routine schedule update; (4) Michael Bisping returning to commentary is a commentator news story, not a major sports event. Only the U.S. Open win (J.J. Spaun) is tier 1 content. Per the mandatory rules, 4+ weak stories require a -3 score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All five selected stories are weak in terms of starpower and casual fan interest. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is not a golf major and features a non-household name, which is explicitly low starpower. Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is a routine broadcast update, not a major event. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a minor college update. Sean Payton's comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos' defense is a routine offseason NFL story with no major star or breaking news. The Astros' injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is a standard injury report, not a major star or playoff context. According to the mandatory counting rule, 4+ weak stories require a -3 score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are weak in terms of starpower and casual fan interest. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is not a golf major and features a non-household name, which is explicitly low starpower. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is a routine broadcast update, not a major event. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a minor college update. Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos&#39; defense is a routine offseason NFL story with no major star or breaking news. The Astros&#39; injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is a standard injury report, not a major star or playoff context. According to the mandatory counting rule, 4+ weak stories require a -3 score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

{
  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection features 4 stories with strong starpower and relevance, with only 1 potentially weaker story. The strengths include: (1) Red Sox trading All-Star Devers to Giants - major MLB trade involving a star player, (2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open - a golf major championship which is tier 1 content regardless of player fame, (3) NBA Finals Game 5 coverage - championship-level content with maximum relevance, (4) Giancarlo Stanton (Yankees star) returning from injury - while injury returns can be routine, Stanton is a major star on the Yankees (premier franchise). The only potentially weaker story is the U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement, which depends on which players were named, but Olympic team announcements with major stars qualify as tier 1 content. This selection hits the right balance of major sports (MLB, NBA, NHL, golf) with genuinely newsworthy developments that casual fans would discuss.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">This selection contains 5 weak stories that fail to meet the criteria for sports relevance. 1) Cardinals minicamp workload management is routine NFL offseason content. 2) Southern Conference Pitcher entering transfer portal is minor college sports news. 3) Simone Biles' apology is a trivial celebrity controversy, not substantive sports news. 4) Katie Boulter at Queen's features a non-household name in tennis. 5) WNBA injury report about Courtney Vandersloot (not Angel Reese as the headline suggests) is routine content without major star power. All 5 stories fall into the weak content categories that trigger penalties - none feature major stars in significant competitive contexts, championship moments, or high-profile trades that would appeal to casual sports fans. This selection completely lacks tier 1 content that would generate widespread interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">This selection contains exactly 3 tier 1 stories and 2 weaker stories, making it a +1 by the boundary rule. The tier 1 stories are: (1) Tyrese Haliburton's injury for NBA Finals Game 6 - major playoff context with a star player; (2) US Hockey Olympic roster announcement featuring genuine superstars like Matthews and the Tkachuk brothers; (3) Rafael Devers MLB trade with David Ortiz commentary - major star trade with Hall of Fame player input. The two weaker stories are: (1) The NFL 25-year retrospective list, which falls under 'retrospective lists' in the weak content category; and (2) The routine WNBA in-season tournament update without specific star focus. While the selection has good sport diversity and some high-profile content, the presence of exactly 2 weaker stories prevents a higher score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">This selection contains 5 weak stories that fail to meet the criteria for high relevance to sports fans. Let's count the weak stories: 1) PGA expert picks for Travelers Championship (expert picks are explicitly listed as weak content), 2) Duke freshmen rankings (retrospective list with no current news value), 3) Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement (routine schedule news), 4) UFC commentator assignment (commentator news explicitly listed as weak), 5) College basketball transfer portal/roster moves with Cooper Flagg. None of these stories feature major stars in significant current events, championship contexts, or breaking news that would interest casual fans. Even J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, which should be tier 1 content, is misrepresented - the curator selected article #218 about Spaun winning, but completely ignored available tier 1 content like NBA Finals Game 6 injury updates (article #252), Stanley Cup Finals (article #237), and the Yankees' Stanton return (article #230). This selection fails on all criteria and contains the mandatory 5 weak stories that require a -3 score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection contains 5 weak stories that fail to meet the criteria for high relevance to sports fans. Let&#39;s count the weak stories: 1) PGA expert picks for Travelers Championship (expert picks are explicitly listed as weak content), 2) Duke freshmen rankings (retrospective list with no current news value), 3) Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement (routine schedule news), 4) UFC commentator assignment (commentator news explicitly listed as weak), 5) College basketball transfer portal/roster moves with Cooper Flagg. None of these stories feature major stars in significant current events, championship contexts, or breaking news that would interest casual fans. Even J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, which should be tier 1 content, is misrepresented - the curator selected article #218 about Spaun winning, but completely ignored available tier 1 content like NBA Finals Game 6 injury updates (article #252), Stanley Cup Finals (article #237), and the Yankees&#39; Stanton return (article #230). This selection fails on all criteria and contains the mandatory 5 weak stories that require a -3 score.&quot;

All 5 stories trigger the mandatory counting rule for weak content: (1) PGA expert picks for a non-major tournament, (2) UFC commentator news, (3) Oklahoma SEC basketball schedule announcement, (4) Coach commentary about team defense helping a rookie QB, and (5) Routine injury report for a non-superstar pitcher. None of these stories feature major stars in significant contexts or represent tier 1 content. There are no championship games, major trades, or household name events.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;This selection contains 5 weak stories that lack significant starpower and casual fan interest. All 5 stories trigger the mandatory counting rule for weak content: (1) PGA expert picks for a non-major tournament, (2) UFC commentator news, (3) Oklahoma SEC basketball schedule announcement, (4) Coach commentary about team defense helping a rookie QB, and (5) Routine injury report for a non-superstar pitcher. None of these stories feature major stars in significant contexts or represent tier 1 content. There are no championship games, major trades, or household name events. With 5 weak stories counted, this selection receives a mandatory -3 score per the evaluation criteria.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">This is an excellent selection of 5 stories with exceptional relevance for sports fans. All stories feature major stars/teams and have high casual fan interest: (1) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a tier 1 golf major victory - these are household name events with broad appeal; (2) Rafael Devers trade is a blockbuster MLB move involving an All-Star player; (3) Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is championship-level NHL content; (4) Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for NBA Finals Game 6 is highly relevant playoff news involving a star player; (5) Giancarlo Stanton's return to the Yankees lineup is significant MLB news about a major star. Every selection represents tier 1 content with genuine starpower and prominence. There are no weak stories in this group - no routine updates, minor players, or niche content. This selection perfectly balances major sports (NBA, MLB, NHL, golf) with timely, high-impact stories that would interest even casual sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;
