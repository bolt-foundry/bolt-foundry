Even one major star doesn't save a poor overall selection.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Even one major star doesn't save a poor overall selection.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The stories about Rafael Devers' trade, the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup, and Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals all feature significant starpower and are of high interest to casual fans. The inclusion of Giancarlo Stanton's return also adds to the starpower, given his prominence in MLB. The story about J.J.

Even one major star doesn't save a poor overall selection.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Even one major star doesn't save a poor overall selection.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, so it lacks starpower compared to the others.

The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a major story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton's return is also notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win, while less star-powered, is a major event in golf. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly relevant, though the teams are not the most prominent.

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

The story about Simone Biles has high starpower due to her prominence as an Olympic gymnast, and the Chicago Sky story involves a significant injury in the WNBA, which may interest basketball fans. The Cardinals minicamp story involves an NFL team, which has broad appeal, though the specific content is less dramatic. The Katie Boulter tennis story and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story have lower starpower and casual fan interest, as they involve less prominent athletes and events. Overall, some stories have decent relevance, but others are weaker in terms of starpower and interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and casual fan interest. The story about J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory has some relevance due to the dramatic nature of a comeback win in a major golf tournament, but Spaun is not a major star. The article on Robert MacIntyre for the Travelers Championship lacks significant starpower. The Duke freshmen ranking, featuring Zion Williamson, has high starpower and interest due to Zion's prominence. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is of limited interest outside of college basketball fans. Michael Bisping's return for UFC commentary has some casual fan interest but lacks major starpower. Overall, the selection has some relevant stories but also includes weaker ones in terms of starpower and broad appeal.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and casual fan interest. The story about J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory has some relevance due to the dramatic nature of a comeback win in a major golf tournament, but Spaun is not a major star. The article on Robert MacIntyre for the Travelers Championship lacks significant starpower. The Duke freshmen ranking, featuring Zion Williamson, has high starpower and interest due to Zion&#39;s prominence. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is of limited interest outside of college basketball fans. Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary has some casual fan interest but lacks major starpower. Overall, the selection has some relevant stories but also includes weaker ones in terms of starpower and broad appeal.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selected stories lack significant starpower and prominence. None of the stories feature major superstar athletes or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest. The stories about Robert MacIntyre, Michael Bisping, and Bo Nix involve less prominent figures in their respective sports. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement and Lance McCullers Jr.'s injury are not particularly compelling for casual fans. Overall, the selection does not include stories with high casual fan interest or dramatic storylines, and the timeliness of the stories does not compensate for the lack of starpower.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selected stories lack significant starpower and prominence. None of the stories feature major superstar athletes or high-profile teams that would generate widespread interest. The stories about Robert MacIntyre, Michael Bisping, and Bo Nix involve less prominent figures in their respective sports. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement and Lance McCullers Jr.&#39;s injury are not particularly compelling for casual fans. Overall, the selection does not include stories with high casual fan interest or dramatic storylines, and the timeliness of the stories does not compensate for the lack of starpower.&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

The Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers is a major MLB story involving a prominent player and team. Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees is also highly relevant due to his starpower and the team's prominence. J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a significant golf event, though Spaun himself is not a household name, the event's prestige boosts its relevance. The NBA Finals story (Pacers vs. Thunder) is highly relevant due to the event's magnitude, though neither team is a traditional powerhouse, but the Finals always draw attention. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and of interest, though not as high-profile as the others. Overall, the group is strong, but not all stories are at the absolute top tier of starpower or casual fan interest.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes one story with very high starpower and broad interest (Simone Biles), and another with moderate prominence (Chicago Sky, Angel Reese, and Courtney Vandersloot in the WNBA). The Cardinals minicamp story involves an NFL team, which is a major league, but the story itself is minor and not about a star player. The Katie Boulter tennis story is about a national No. 1 but not a global star, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is low in both starpower and casual fan interest. Overall, only one or two stories are highly relevant to most sports fans, while the rest are of moderate or low interest, so the group as a whole is only somewhat relevant.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

The Devers trade involves a major MLB star and a storied franchise, which is a blockbuster move. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey, especially as it's their second consecutive title. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is crucial news for the NBA Finals, involving a star player and a must-win game. Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees is significant due to his starpower and the prominence of the Yankees. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a major golf championship, and while Spaun is not a household name, the U.S. Open itself is a marquee event.

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are highly relevant for sports fans. The Devers trade involves a major MLB star and a storied franchise, which is a blockbuster move. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major event in hockey, especially as it&#39;s their second consecutive title. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is crucial news for the NBA Finals, involving a star player and a must-win game. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is significant due to his starpower and the prominence of the Yankees. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a major golf championship, and while Spaun is not a household name, the U.S. Open itself is a marquee event. All stories have high starpower, team prominence, and broad casual fan interest, with strong timeliness.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selected stories are a mix of moderate to low relevance for the general sports fan. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (with Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg) has clear starpower and broad interest. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name. The Travelers Championship preview and expert pick is a niche golf betting story, not a headline for casual fans. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is not a high-interest story outside of that fanbase. Michael Bisping's return to commentary is notable for UFC fans but lacks cross-sport or mainstream appeal. Overall, the group lacks major stars, high-profile teams, or dramatic storylines that would engage most sports fans.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 0,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selected stories are a mix of moderate to low relevance for the general sports fan. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (with Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg) has clear starpower and broad interest. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name. The Travelers Championship preview and expert pick is a niche golf betting story, not a headline for casual fans. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is not a high-interest story outside of that fanbase. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is notable for UFC fans but lacks cross-sport or mainstream appeal. Overall, the group lacks major stars, high-profile teams, or dramatic storylines that would engage most sports fans.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Most of the selected stories lack high starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship golf pick (Robert MacIntyre) does not feature a household name or a major event. Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is notable for MMA fans but not a major sports headline. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule is relevant to a niche college basketball audience, not the broader sports public. The Broncos' defensive strategy for Bo Nix is a minor NFL storyline, as Bo Nix is not yet a star. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is relevant for Astros fans but not a major MLB headline. Overall, the group misses out on top stars, major teams, or dramatic storylines that would appeal to most sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Most of the selected stories lack high starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship golf pick (Robert MacIntyre) does not feature a household name or a major event. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is notable for MMA fans but not a major sports headline. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule is relevant to a niche college basketball audience, not the broader sports public. The Broncos&#39; defensive strategy for Bo Nix is a minor NFL storyline, as Bo Nix is not yet a star. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is relevant for Astros fans but not a major MLB headline. Overall, the group misses out on top stars, major teams, or dramatic storylines that would appeal to most sports fans.&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories have high starpower/prominence and high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: Most stories have good starpower/prominence or interest  \n- **+1**: Some stories have decent relevance but others are weak\n- **-1**: Most stories lack starpower/prominence and interest\n- **-2**: Stories are mostly irrelevant with low starpower and little casual fan interest\n- **-3**: All stories are completely irrelevant&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are highly relevant for sports fans. The group includes major starpower and prominent teams: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (blockbuster MLB news), the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton (a superstar on a marquee team), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (major NHL event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player in a championship series), and J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open (a golf major). Each story has high casual fan interest, involving dramatic events, championships, or major player/team moves. All are timely and current. This is an excellent, well-balanced selection for broad sports fan appeal.&quot;

The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a high-profile story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton's return also involves a prominent player, though it's a routine injury update. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is notable but lacks major starpower. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is relevant, but the teams and players involved are not specified, which affects the starpower assessment. The U.S. hockey roster announcement has limited appeal outside of Olympic contexts. Overall, the selection has some strong stories but also notable weak spots in terms of starpower and broad appeal.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major MLB story with broad appeal. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status is crucial for the NBA Finals, involving a key player in a major event. Giancarlo Stanton's return to the Yankees is notable due to his star status. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win, while less prominent than the others, still holds interest as a major golf event. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with the golf story being the weakest in terms of starpower but still relevant due to the nature of the event.</div>

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major MLB story with broad appeal. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is crucial for the NBA Finals, involving a key player in a major event. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return to the Yankees is notable due to his star status. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win, while less prominent than the others, still holds interest as a major golf event. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with the golf story being the weakest in terms of starpower but still relevant due to the nature of the event.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories fall short. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun and the Travelers Championship prediction are niche golf stories with limited casual fan interest. The announcement of Oklahoma's SEC basketball opponents is routine and lacks broad appeal. Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is a minor update with limited interest. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or routine updates with little relevance to casual sports fans.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories fall short. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun and the Travelers Championship prediction are niche golf stories with limited casual fan interest. The announcement of Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents is routine and lacks broad appeal. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is a minor update with limited interest. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or routine updates with little relevance to casual sports fans.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include niche sports and minor updates: 1) Robert MacIntyre in golf lacks widespread starpower; 2) Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is not a major headline; 3) Oklahoma's SEC basketball opponents announcement is routine; 4) Sean Payton's comments on Bo Nix and Broncos' defense lacks broad interest; 5) Lance McCullers Jr.'s injury update is a minor personnel move. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or minor stories with little appeal to casual sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include niche sports and minor updates: 1) Robert MacIntyre in golf lacks widespread starpower; 2) Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is not a major headline; 3) Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents announcement is routine; 4) Sean Payton&#39;s comments on Bo Nix and Broncos&#39; defense lacks broad interest; 5) Lance McCullers Jr.&#39;s injury update is a minor personnel move. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or minor stories with little appeal to casual sports fans.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories includes several high-profile athletes and teams, which aligns well with the criteria for starpower and prominence. The stories about Rafael Devers' trade, the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup, and Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals all feature significant starpower and are of high interest to casual fans. The inclusion of Giancarlo Stanton's return also adds to the starpower, given his prominence in MLB. The story about J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while less prominent in terms of starpower, still holds interest due to the dramatic nature of a major golf title. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, making this a solid selection with only minor room for improvement.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories includes several high-profile athletes and teams, which aligns well with the criteria for starpower and prominence. The stories about Rafael Devers&#39; trade, the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup, and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals all feature significant starpower and are of high interest to casual fans. The inclusion of Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return also adds to the starpower, given his prominence in MLB. The story about J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while less prominent in terms of starpower, still holds interest due to the dramatic nature of a major golf title. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, making this a solid selection with only minor room for improvement.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection is a mixed bag. The Devers trade is a major MLB story with starpower and broad interest. Stanton's return is relevant due to his name and the Yankees' prominence, but as a routine injury return, it has lower casual fan interest. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a major event, but Spaun himself lacks starpower. The Pacers-Thunder NBA Finals story would be highly relevant, but there is no such article in the provided set, so it appears fabricated or mismatched. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely but lacks starpower unless major names are included (not specified). Overall, only 2-3 stories have decent relevance, but the selection has notable weak spots and a possible error, so it fits a 'mixed bag' rating.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains only one story with major starpower and broad casual fan interest: Simone Biles (article 36), who is a household name and whose comments on women's sports are widely relevant. The Chicago Sky story (42) is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese's prominence, but the main focus is on Courtney Vandersloot, who, while respected, is not a major star for casual fans. The Cardinals minicamp story (32) is a routine personnel update about a non-marquee NFL team with no major stars mentioned. Katie Boulter (38) is a British tennis player with limited international starpower, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer (48) is a niche college baseball story with very little broad appeal. Overall, at least two stories are clearly minor/niche, and only one has true starpower, making this a below-average selection.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad casual fan interest: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big-market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, high-profile event), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (superstar, iconic franchise). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event in golf, but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the U.S. Open win still carries significant interest. Overall, this is a strong, timely, and relevant selection, just shy of perfect due to the lack of a true superstar in the golf story.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad casual fan interest: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big-market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, high-profile event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (superstar, iconic franchise). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event in golf, but Spaun himself is not a household name, which slightly lowers the overall starpower. However, the U.S. Open win still carries significant interest. Overall, this is a strong, timely, and relevant selection, just shy of perfect due to the lack of a true superstar in the golf story.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection is mostly composed of stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun (218) is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name and lacks broad starpower. The Travelers Championship pick (250) focuses on Robert MacIntyre, who is not a major star. The Duke freshmen ranking (254) has some interest due to Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg, but is more of a retrospective/college niche story. Oklahoma's SEC basketball opponents (244) is a routine schedule announcement with little broad appeal. Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary (240) is a minor broadcast note, not a major sports headline. Overall, the group lacks major stars, high-profile teams, or stories with strong casual fan interest.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection is mostly composed of stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun (218) is a major event, but Spaun is not a household name and lacks broad starpower. The Travelers Championship pick (250) focuses on Robert MacIntyre, who is not a major star. The Duke freshmen ranking (254) has some interest due to Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg, but is more of a retrospective/college niche story. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents (244) is a routine schedule announcement with little broad appeal. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary (240) is a minor broadcast note, not a major sports headline. Overall, the group lacks major stars, high-profile teams, or stories with strong casual fan interest.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection is dominated by stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks a major golf star; Michael Bisping's return to commentary is niche MMA news, not a headline for casual fans. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule is a routine update with little broad appeal. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach, neither of whom are major NFL stars. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a minor personnel move, not a headline event. None of the stories feature superstar athletes or high-profile teams, and all are of limited interest to the general sports audience.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection is dominated by stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) lacks a major golf star; Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is niche MMA news, not a headline for casual fans. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule is a routine update with little broad appeal. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach, neither of whom are major NFL stars. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a minor personnel move, not a headline event. None of the stories feature superstar athletes or high-profile teams, and all are of limited interest to the general sports audience.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad interest: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, high-profile event), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic franchise). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, so it lacks starpower compared to the others. Overall, the selection is highly relevant and newsworthy for sports fans, but not perfect due to the inclusion of a less prominent individual in a major event.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most relevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or niche sports have LOW starpower\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Important**: Grade the OVERALL selection quality. Even one major star doesn&#39;t save a poor overall selection.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Red Flags (strongly suggest negative scores)\n- Multiple stories about minor conferences, backup players, or niche sports\n- Routine injury updates or minor personnel moves\n- Stories that only appeal to hardcore fans of specific teams\n- Multiple international/less popular sports without major star power&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad interest: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), the Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, high-profile event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (major MLB star, iconic franchise). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, so it lacks starpower compared to the others. Overall, the selection is highly relevant and newsworthy for sports fans, but not perfect due to the inclusion of a less prominent individual in a major event.&quot;
