A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

The David Ortiz and Rafael Devers trade story involves a well-known figure in Ortiz, but the story itself is not highly impactful. The NFL 25-year best roster is an interesting retrospective with broad appeal, featuring major stars like Tom Brady. The WNBA story, while covering an exciting event, lacks major starpower.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars mentioned.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

The WNBA Commissioner's Cup story is the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus and is more niche, but the league's rising profile and the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it from being a total miss.

The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event but Spaun himself lacks broad starpower; however, the U.S. Open is a top-tier golf event with wide interest. Overall, this is a strong selection with only a minor weak spot in individual starpower for the golf story, but the event itself compensates.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles.

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list -

DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n223,\\\"US hockey announces initial 6 players for 2026 Milan Olympics\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/article/us-hockey-announces-initial-6-193402190.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:02.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.335Z\\\",60,\\\"The U.S. named Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Quinn Hughes and Charlie McAvoy as its first six players for the 2026 Olympics, avoiding goaltenders on the initial roster unvei...\\\"\\n221,\\\"David Ortiz responds to Red Sox's Rafael Devers trade: 'You've got to put your ego aside'\\\",\\\"Yahoo Sports\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/david-ortiz-responds-to-red-soxs-rafael-devers-trade-youve-got-to-put-your-ego-aside-193444836.html\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:34:44.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-16T19:48:09.214Z\\\",60,\\\"David Ortiz changed course after supporting Rafael Devers in early June....\\\"\\n235,\\\"The ultimate NFL team from past 25 years: Who makes the 53-man roster, practice squad and coaching staff?\\\",\\\"ESPN\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/45042048/nfl-best-all-quarter-century-team-25-years-tom-brady-randy-moss-ray-lewis\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:52:52.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:37.061Z\\\",60,\\\"In honor of hitting the quarter-century mark, we built a 53-man roster of the best NFL players from the past 25 years.

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don't dock points for legitimate major sports content\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\\n\\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \\n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\\n\\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n\\n**Examples requiring -3:**\\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n\\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\\n\\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

You'll be\\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we'll explain in a\\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\\nunderstand if the assistant's response correctly matches the criteria provided.\\n\\n## Grading process\\n\\n1. You'll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\\n   response.\\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\\n   criteria.\\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\\n4. If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \\\"score\\\" and \\\"reason\\\" fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rules**: \\n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\\n  -

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a high-profile story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton's return is also notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a major event in golf, though Spaun himself may not have widespread starpower. The NBA Finals story involving the Pacers and Thunder is relevant, but lacks specific starpower details. The U.S. hockey roster announcement is timely but not particularly high-profile. Overall, the selection has some strong stories but also notable weak spots, particularly in terms of starpower and broad appeal.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and interest. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, to the Giants is a high-profile story with significant interest. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is also notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a major event in golf, though Spaun himself may not have widespread starpower. The NBA Finals story involving the Pacers and Thunder is relevant, but lacks specific starpower details. The U.S. hockey roster announcement is timely but not particularly high-profile. Overall, the selection has some strong stories but also notable weak spots, particularly in terms of starpower and broad appeal.&quot;

The Cardinals minicamp update (articleId 32) and the Southern Conference transfer portal story (articleId 48) are routine updates with minimal relevance to casual fans. The Katie Boulter story (articleId 38) involves a moderate-level tennis player with limited appeal.

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple stories with minimal starpower and broad appeal. The story about Simone Biles (articleId 36) is the only one featuring a major star with potential casual fan interest. The Chicago Sky story (articleId 42) involves a significant injury but lacks major starpower. The Cardinals minicamp update (articleId 32) and the Southern Conference transfer portal story (articleId 48) are routine updates with minimal relevance to casual fans. The Katie Boulter story (articleId 38) involves a moderate-level tennis player with limited appeal. Overall, the selection lacks stories with major stars or high casual fan interest, and includes multiple niche or routine updates, warranting a low score.&quot;

The Tyrese Haliburton injury story is timely and relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, but Haliburton is not a major star. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement features prominent players like Auston Matthews, which is of interest to fans. The David Ortiz and Rafael Devers trade story involves a well-known figure in Ortiz, but the story itself is not highly impactful. The NFL 25-year best roster is an interesting retrospective with broad appeal, featuring major stars like Tom Brady. The WNBA story, while covering an exciting event, lacks major starpower. Overall, the selection has some strong stories but also notable weak spots, particularly in terms of starpower and broad appeal.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 1,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes a mix of stories with varying levels of starpower and interest. The Tyrese Haliburton injury story is timely and relevant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, but Haliburton is not a major star. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement features prominent players like Auston Matthews, which is of interest to fans. The David Ortiz and Rafael Devers trade story involves a well-known figure in Ortiz, but the story itself is not highly impactful. The NFL 25-year best roster is an interesting retrospective with broad appeal, featuring major stars like Tom Brady. The WNBA story, while covering an exciting event, lacks major starpower. Overall, the selection has some strong stories but also notable weak spots, particularly in terms of starpower and broad appeal.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) are both high-profile MLB stories. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals are also highly relevant, featuring prominent teams and players. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while less star-studded, still holds interest due to the major title win. Overall, the selection is strong, with only minor room for improvement in terms of starpower.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes four stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) are both high-profile MLB stories. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals are also highly relevant, featuring prominent teams and players. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while less star-studded, still holds interest due to the major title win. Overall, the selection is strong, with only minor room for improvement in terms of starpower.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke's top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star and prominent team, which is relevant to both casual and dedicated sports fans. The other stories, such as the PGA expert backing Robert MacIntyre and the announcement of Oklahoma's SEC basketball opponents, lack the starpower and broad appeal necessary for high relevance. The inclusion of a story about Michael Bisping's return to commentary and a niche golf event further diminishes the selection's relevance. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or minor stories with limited interest to casual sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. Only one story, about Duke&#39;s top freshmen including Zion Williamson, features a major star and prominent team, which is relevant to both casual and dedicated sports fans. The other stories, such as the PGA expert backing Robert MacIntyre and the announcement of Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents, lack the starpower and broad appeal necessary for high relevance. The inclusion of a story about Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary and a niche golf event further diminishes the selection&#39;s relevance. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche or minor stories with limited interest to casual sports fans.&quot;

None of the stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams. The stories about Robert MacIntyre in golf and Michael Bisping in UFC lack widespread interest among casual sports fans. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Sean Payton's comments on Bo Nix are niche and not of high interest. The injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is routine and lacks significant starpower. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche and minor stories with minimal relevance to a broad sports audience.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. None of the stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams. The stories about Robert MacIntyre in golf and Michael Bisping in UFC lack widespread interest among casual sports fans. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Sean Payton&#39;s comments on Bo Nix are niche and not of high interest. The injury update on Lance McCullers Jr. is routine and lacks significant starpower. Overall, the selection is dominated by niche and minor stories with minimal relevance to a broad sports audience.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes 4 stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve major MLB stars and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL, and Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals is relevant to a major ongoing sports event. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, the selection is strong but not perfect, as it includes one story with less starpower.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 4 stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton both involve major MLB stars and teams, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a high-profile event in the NHL, and Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status in the NBA Finals is relevant to a major ongoing sports event. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, the selection is strong but not perfect, as it includes one story with less starpower.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Three stories have strong starpower and casual fan interest: the Devers trade (major MLB star, big market teams), Giancarlo Stanton's return (Yankees star), and the NBA Finals Game 5 (assuming this is a real, current event, though no matching article was provided). The U.S. Open golf win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself lacks starpower for casual fans. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some broad appeal, but naming only six players (and no major stars mentioned) is not a top headline. The selection is weakened by the inclusion of at least two stories with limited starpower, but the presence of three strong stories keeps it above average.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains multiple stories with minimal starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles story is the only one with true major starpower and broad appeal. The Chicago Sky story is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese's prominence, but the main news is about Courtney Vandersloot, who is not a household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars mentioned. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with low international profile, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche. With at least three stories lacking starpower and broad appeal, this selection warrants a -2 score per the guidelines.</div>

If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with minimal starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles story is the only one with true major starpower and broad appeal. The Chicago Sky story is somewhat relevant due to Angel Reese&#39;s prominence, but the main news is about Courtney Vandersloot, who is not a household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars mentioned. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a player with low international profile, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is highly niche. With at least three stories lacking starpower and broad appeal, this selection warrants a -2 score per the guidelines.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: Haliburton's injury in the NBA Finals (major star, high stakes), US Hockey Olympic roster (features Matthews and Tkachuk brothers, big names), David Ortiz/Red Sox/Devers trade (Ortiz is a legend, Devers is a star, Red Sox are a major franchise), and the NFL all-time 25-year roster (includes Brady, Moss, etc.‚Äîhuge names, fun for casual fans). The WNBA Commissioner's Cup story is the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus and is more niche, but the league's rising profile and the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it from being a total miss. Overall, this is a strong, relevant selection with only one notable weak spot.</div>

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: Haliburton&#39;s injury in the NBA Finals (major star, high stakes), US Hockey Olympic roster (features Matthews and Tkachuk brothers, big names), David Ortiz/Red Sox/Devers trade (Ortiz is a legend, Devers is a star, Red Sox are a major franchise), and the NFL all-time 25-year roster (includes Brady, Moss, etc.‚Äîhuge names, fun for casual fans). The WNBA Commissioner&#39;s Cup story is the weakest, as it lacks a specific superstar focus and is more niche, but the league&#39;s rising profile and the mention of Kahleah Copper (an All-Star) keep it from being a total miss. Overall, this is a strong, relevant selection with only one notable weak spot.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, huge franchise), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, starpower), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (superstar, iconic team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event but Spaun himself lacks broad starpower; however, the U.S. Open is a top-tier golf event with wide interest. Overall, this is a strong selection with only a minor weak spot in individual starpower for the golf story, but the event itself compensates. No major penalties apply.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or events: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, huge franchise), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (championship, starpower), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (superstar, iconic team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major event but Spaun himself lacks broad starpower; however, the U.S. Open is a top-tier golf event with wide interest. Overall, this is a strong selection with only a minor weak spot in individual starpower for the golf story, but the event itself compensates. No major penalties apply.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant golf event, but Spaun is not a household name. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche betting/preview story about a non-star golfer. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a routine college basketball schedule update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a minor broadcast note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (Travelers pick, Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (Zion Williamson, Cooper Flagg) has major starpower and broad appeal. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a significant golf event, but Spaun is not a household name. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche betting/preview story about a non-star golfer. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a routine college basketball schedule update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return is a minor broadcast note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (Travelers pick, Oklahoma SEC schedule, Bisping commentary) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche golf story without a major star. Michael Bisping's return to commentary is only of interest to hardcore UFC fans, not casuals. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with little national appeal. Sean Payton/Bo Nix is about a rookie QB and a rebuilding team, not a headline-grabbing star or franchise. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a non-superstar pitcher. There are no Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars, and at least three stories are minor/niche or routine updates, triggering a harsh penalty.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship pick (Robert MacIntyre) is a niche golf story without a major star. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is only of interest to hardcore UFC fans, not casuals. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a routine college update with little national appeal. Sean Payton/Bo Nix is about a rookie QB and a rebuilding team, not a headline-grabbing star or franchise. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update about a non-superstar pitcher. There are no Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars, and at least three stories are minor/niche or routine updates, triggering a harsh penalty.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All 5 stories feature major stars, teams, or events with high casual fan interest. The U.S. Open golf win is a major championship, the Red Sox-Giants Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an All-Star and two storied franchises, the Panthers' Stanley Cup win is a championship moment, Haliburton's injury status is crucial to the NBA Finals, and Stanton's return is a headline for the Yankees, a marquee MLB team. Each story is timely, features high starpower, and would interest both dedicated and casual sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes 4 stories with genuine starpower and strong interest: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, the NBA Finals Game 5, and the U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement. These stories feature major stars, prominent teams, and high-profile events that appeal to casual fans. The story about Giancarlo Stanton's return from injury is less impactful but does involve a well-known player. Overall, the selection is strong with only one weaker story, justifying a score of +2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes multiple weak stories that lack major starpower or broad appeal. The stories about the Cardinals' minicamp, a college pitcher entering the transfer portal, and Katie Boulter's win at a non-major tennis tournament are all considered weak due to their low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Additionally, the Simone Biles apology and the WNBA injury report, while involving known figures, are not substantive enough to elevate the selection. With 4+ weak stories, the score must be -3 according to the mandatory scoring rules.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

The Tyrese Haliburton injury update is significant due to its impact on the NBA Finals, which is a high-profile event. The US Hockey Olympic roster announcement includes major stars like Auston Matthews, which adds starpower. However, the David Ortiz commentary on the Rafael Devers trade lacks substantive content and is more of a reaction piece, which is weak. The NFL retrospective list, while interesting, is not current news and lacks timeliness. The WNBA story, despite being about an in-season tournament, does not feature major stars or historic moments, making it weak. Overall, only 2 stories have genuine starpower, while 3 are weak or routine content, leading to a score of -1.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

Spaun's U.S. Open victory, which is highly relevant. However, the other stories are weak: the Travelers Championship prediction lacks starpower, the Duke freshmen ranking is retrospective and lacks current relevance, the Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is routine college sports content, and Michael Bisping's return to commentary is trivial. With 4 weak stories, the selection must be scored -3 according to the mandatory counting rule.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes multiple weak stories with low starpower and casual fan interest. The only tier 1 story is J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, which is highly relevant. However, the other stories are weak: the Travelers Championship prediction lacks starpower, the Duke freshmen ranking is retrospective and lacks current relevance, the Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is routine college sports content, and Michael Bisping&#39;s return to commentary is trivial. With 4 weak stories, the selection must be scored -3 according to the mandatory counting rule.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes 5 stories, all of which are weak in terms of player starpower and team prominence. The stories cover routine content such as expert predictions for a non-major golf event, a commentator&#39;s return for a UFC event, a college basketball schedule announcement, a coach&#39;s opinion on a team&#39;s defense, and an injury report for a non-star player. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams, nor do they have significant casual fan interest or timeliness.

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes five stories with high relevance and star power. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event, equivalent to a household name moment. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a significant MLB transaction. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major NHL event. The injury status of Tyrese Haliburton is crucial as it pertains to the NBA Finals, a high-stakes context. Lastly, Giancarlo Stanton's return to the Yankees is notable due to his star power and the prominence of the team. All stories have strong casual fan interest and timeliness, making this a highly relevant selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories are tier 1 or have strong starpower and broad interest: (1) Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers is a major MLB move involving a prominent team and star, (2) J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open is a golf major and always tier 1, (3) NBA Finals Game 5 is a top-tier event, and (4) U.S. Olympic hockey roster announcement (assuming it includes major NHL stars) is high-profile. The fifth story, Giancarlo Stanton's return, is a routine injury return, which is weak, but the other four stories are strong enough for a +2. If the Olympic hockey story did not include major stars, the score would be lower, but as written, it is likely to be of high interest.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All five selected stories are weak according to the grading criteria. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel/injury report. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year entering the transfer portal is a minor college move. Simone Biles' apology is a trivial celebrity controversy, not a substantive sports achievement. Katie Boulter's Queen's win is a non-household name in a non-major tennis event. The Chicago Sky story is a WNBA injury report, which is considered weak unless involving a major star or historic moment. With 4+ weak stories, the mandatory score is -3.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Let's count the weak stories: (1) The Haliburton injury update is only relevant if it's a Finals injury for a major star, but the Pacers and Haliburton are not at the LeBron/Curry level, so this is borderline but not tier 1. (2) US Hockey Olympic roster announcement includes major NHL stars (Matthews, Tkachuk), so this is strong. (3) David Ortiz commenting on a Rafael Devers trade is a reaction piece, not a major trade itself‚Äîthis is weak. (4) The NFL all-time 25-year roster is a retrospective list, not current news‚Äîthis is weak. (5) WNBA Commissioner's Cup group play is routine WNBA content, not a historic moment or major star event‚Äîthis is weak. That makes 3 weak stories (Ortiz reaction, NFL retrospective, WNBA routine), so by the rules, this is a -2. There is some redeeming content (Olympic roster, possibly Haliburton injury if Pacers are in Finals), but the majority is weak or routine.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or tier 1 events. The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a championship moment in a major sport. Haliburton's injury status is directly tied to the NBA Finals, involving a star player and a must-win game. Stanton's return for the Yankees is a major star on a marquee team. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open win is a golf major, which is tier 1 content. All stories have high casual fan interest and starpower, with no weak or filler content. This is a textbook +3 selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five stories are highly relevant and feature major stars, teams, or tier 1 events. The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a championship moment in a major sport. Haliburton&#39;s injury status is directly tied to the NBA Finals, involving a star player and a must-win game. Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees is a major star on a marquee team. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a golf major, which is tier 1 content. All stories have high casual fan interest and starpower, with no weak or filler content. This is a textbook +3 selection.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five selected stories are weak by the grading criteria: (1) PGA expert picks for the Travelers Championship is low starpower and not a major, (2) ranking Duke freshmen is a retrospective list, (3) Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents is a routine schedule announcement, and (4) Michael Bisping returning to commentary is a commentator news story. Only the U.S. Open win (J.J. Spaun) is tier 1 content. Per the mandatory rules, 4+ weak stories require a -3 score.&quot;

The Travelers Championship expert pick is not a golf major and features a non-household name (Robert MacIntyre), which is low starpower. Michael Bisping's return to UFC commentary is a routine broadcast update, not a major event. Oklahoma's SEC basketball schedule announcement is a minor college update. Sean Payton's comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos' defense is a routine offseason NFL story with no major star or breaking news. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine MLB injury report, not a major star or playoff context. This selection contains 5 weak stories, triggering the mandatory -3 score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five selected stories are weak in terms of starpower and casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship expert pick is not a golf major and features a non-household name (Robert MacIntyre), which is low starpower. Michael Bisping&#39;s return to UFC commentary is a routine broadcast update, not a major event. Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball schedule announcement is a minor college update. Sean Payton&#39;s comments about Bo Nix and the Broncos&#39; defense is a routine offseason NFL story with no major star or breaking news. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine MLB injury report, not a major star or playoff context. This selection contains 5 weak stories, triggering the mandatory -3 score.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n**Response Format**: Provide your evaluation as valid JSON with \&quot;score\&quot; and \&quot;reason\&quot; fields. DO NOT use backticks, code blocks, or markdown formatting in your JSON response.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rules**: \n- Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n- **MANDATORY COUNTING**: Use the weak story checklist - if 4+ stories are weak, MUST be -3\n- **Never downgrade from -3 to -2**: If you count 4+ weak stories, score MUST be -3\n- **Boundary tie-breaker**: When between +1 and -1, count tier 1 stories:\n  - 3+ tier 1 stories = +1\n  - 1-2 tier 1 stories = -1\n- **Consistency check**: If 4+ stories are genuinely tier 1 content, score should be +2 or +3\n- **Avoid over-penalizing**: Don&#39;t dock points for legitimate major sports content\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n  **Note**: Golf majors, MLB All-Star trades, NBA Finals, Stanley Cup = tier 1 content\n- **+1**: EXACTLY 3 stories are tier 1/strong relevance, 2 are weak\n- **-1**: Only 1-2 stories have genuine starpower, 3+ are weak/routine content\n\n**Boundary Rule**: When counting stories, use these strict categories:\n- **Tier 1**: NBA Finals content, Olympics with major stars, major trades, championship games\n- **Weak**: Injury reports, WNBA routine content, commentary/reactions, retrospective lists\n- **-2**: Exactly 3 weak stories from the list above, some redeeming content\n- **-3**: 4+ weak stories from the mandatory list - ALWAYS use -3, never -2\n  **COUNTING RULE**: Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA routine + Biles controversy = 5 weak stories = MANDATORY -3\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**MANDATORY SCORING RULES - COUNT THE WEAK STORIES:**\n\n**Step 1: Count stories that are ANY of these:**\n- Transfer portal/college minor moves\n- Routine injury reports/minicamp updates  \n- Non-household names in tennis/minor sports\n- WNBA routine content (unless major star/historic moment)\n- Trivial celebrity controversies (even with major stars like Simone Biles)\n- Expert picks, schedules, commentator news\n\n**Step 2: Apply MANDATORY scoring:**\n- **3+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -2 or worse\n- **4+ weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3 (not -2)\n- **5 weak stories** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n\n**Examples requiring -3:**\n- Transfer portal + minicamp + tennis non-star + WNBA injury + Biles controversy = 5 weak = -3\n- Expert pick + commentator + schedule + injury + college = 5 weak = -3\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n\n## TIER 1 Content (DO NOT PENALIZE)\n- **Golf majors**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open victories\n- **MLB**: All-Star trades, playoff games, major signings\n- **NBA**: Finals games, superstar moves, playoff drama, **Finals injury reports for star players**\n- **NFL**: Major trades, playoff games, star signings\n- **NHL**: Stanley Cup games, major trades\n- **Tennis**: Grand Slam victories (Wimbledon, US Open, French Open, Australian Open)\n- **Olympics**: Team announcements with major stars (Matthews, McDavid level players)\n\n## WEAK Content (TRIGGERS PENALTIES)\n- **WNBA routine content**: Unless Caitlin Clark or truly historic moments\n- **Injury reports**: Unless Finals/playoff context with major stars\n- **Commentary/reactions**: Retired players commenting on trades\n- **Retrospective lists**: All-time teams, historical rankings without current news value&quot;
