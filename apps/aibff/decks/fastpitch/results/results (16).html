A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars mentioned.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself lacks household name status, making it the weakest of the five. However, the event's prestige compensates somewhat.

A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n\\n## Penalty Guidelines\\n\\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \\n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\\n\\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\\n\\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself lacks household name status, making it the weakest of the five. However, the event's prestige compensates somewhat.

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \" \\n\\\"32\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Arizona Cardinals with 5 players taking it easy during mandatory minicamp\\\",\\\"The Cardinals began mandatory minicamp with 100% attendance, but a few players will not have a full workload.\\\",\\\"https://cardswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/cardinals/2025/06/10/arizona-cardinals-to-take-it-easy-with-these-players-in-minicamp/84133492007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:30:34.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.207Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"48\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters transfer portal\\\",\\\"2025 Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year from Knoxville enters the NCAA transfer portal.\\\",\\\"https://volswire.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/volunteers/baseball/2025/06/10/southern-conference-baseball-pitcher-of-the-year-brady-frederick-enters-transfer-portal-etsu/84132290007/\\\",2025-06-10T21:21:12.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:32.338Z,\\\"50\\\"  \\n\\\"36\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Simone Biles apologizes to Riley Gaines, argues for 'competitive equity and inclusivity' in women's sports\\\",\\\"Simone Biles called Riley Gaines a \\\"\\\"sore loser\\\"\\\" and a \\\"\\\"bully\\\"\\\" Friday.\\\",\\\"https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/article/simone-biles-apologizes-to-riley-gaines-argues-for-competitive-equity-and-inclusivity-in-womens-sports-172622624.html\\\",2025-06-10T21:26:22.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:30.802Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"38\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Boulter makes winning start at 'special' Queen's\\\",\\\"British number one Katie Boulter makes a winning start to her singles campaign at a Queen's tournament she had always \\\"\\\"dreamt\\\"\\\" of playing at.\\\",\\\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cd904yvwwz1o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Byahoo.north.america%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D\\\",2025-06-10T19:31:25.000Z,2025-06-10T21:38:31.040Z,\\\"50\\\"\\n\\\"42\\\",\\\"11\\\",\\\"Chicago Sky React to Major Angel Reese Announcement\\\",\\\"The Chicago Sky had a tough weekend.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower -

One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower -

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower -

Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories.

If you're unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn't\\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\\n\\n### Output Format\\n\\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\\n\\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Specific Task\\n\\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator's selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\\n\\n## Evaluation Criteria\\n\\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\\n\\n1. **Player Starpower & Team Prominence** (highest weight)\\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\\n     sports have LOW starpower\\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\\n\\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\\n\\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\\n\\n## Scoring Guide\\n\\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\\n\\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\\n\\n## Instant Negative Triggers\\n\\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \\n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\\n\\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\\n- Lesser-known international athletes\\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\\n  substantively empty content\\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"assistant\",\n      \"content\": \"What was the user's original message?\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": \"ID,Title,Source Name,Source URL,Article URL,Published Date,Scraped Date,Relevance Score,Content Preview\\n254,\\\"Ranking top Duke freshmen of all-time: Cooper Flagg, Zion Williamson among Blue Devils best first-year stars\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/ranking-top-duke-freshmen-of-all-time-cooper-flagg-zion-williamson-among-blue-devils-best-first-year-stars/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:36:19.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.101Z\\\",50,\\\"Coach K has his opinion on the best freshmen to play for Duke and now we have ours...\\\"\\n253,\\\"2025 NBA Finals odds, Game 6 prediction: Thunder vs. Pacers picks, best bets from NBA expert on 167-91 run\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/2025-nba-finals-odds-game-6-prediction-thunder-vs-pacers-picks-best-bets-from-nba-expert-on-167-91-run/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:43:45.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:43.040Z\\\",70,\\\"SportsLine expert Matt Severance reveals his NBA bets and predictions for Thursday's Game 6 of Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals 2025...\\\"\\n252,\\\"Tyrese Haliburton injury: Pacers' Rick Carlisle updates status for star guard ahead of NBA Finals Game 6\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/tyrese-haliburton-injury-pacers-rick-carlisle-updates-status-for-star-guard-ahead-of-nba-finals-game-6/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:24.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.978Z\\\",80,\\\"Haliburton is dealing with a calf injury, and it's unclear if he'll play in the must-win game...\\\"\\n251,\\\"Fantasy Football Rankings 2025: Sleepers by NFL model that predicted James Cook's monster year\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-rankings-2025-sleepers-by-nfl-model-that-predicted-james-cooks-monster-year/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:44:06.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.919Z\\\",60,\\\"SportsLine simulated the NFL season 10,000 times and revealed its 2025 Fantasy football sleepers for 2025 Fantasy football draft prep...\\\"\\n250,\\\"Travelers Championship 2025 odds, golf picks, predictions, props, date: PGA expert backs Robert MacIntyre\\\",\\\"CBS Sports\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/\\\",\\\"https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/travelers-championship-2025-odds-golf-picks-predictions-props-date-pga-expert-backs-robert-macintyre/\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T14:48:12.000Z\\\",\\\"2025-06-18T15:28:42.860Z\\\",60,\\\"When is the Travelers Championship 2025?

The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a major story with high relevance. Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable due to his prominence with the Yankees. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun, while not featuring a major star, is a significant event in golf. The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is highly relevant, though the specific teams are not the most prominent. The U.S. hockey roster announcement for the Olympics adds international interest.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve high-profile MLB teams and players. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are also of high interest, involving major sports events and prominent players. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while less prominent, still holds some interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with only the golf story being slightly less impactful for casual fans.</div>

You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes several stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The trade of Rafael Devers (a prominent MLB player) and the activation of Giancarlo Stanton (a major star) both involve high-profile MLB teams and players. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are also of high interest, involving major sports events and prominent players. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while less prominent, still holds some interest due to the nature of a major golf tournament. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, with only the golf story being slightly less impactful for casual fans.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are weak in terms of major stars or teams. The golf stories about J.J. Spaun and Robert MacIntyre, while notable in the golf world, do not feature major stars with widespread appeal. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Michael Bisping's return for UFC commentary are niche stories with limited casual fan interest. Overall, the selection fails to include enough high-profile athletes or teams to engage a broad sports audience.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks significant starpower and broad appeal. While the inclusion of Zion Williamson in the Duke freshmen ranking provides some starpower, the other stories are weak in terms of major stars or teams. The golf stories about J.J. Spaun and Robert MacIntyre, while notable in the golf world, do not feature major stars with widespread appeal. The Oklahoma SEC basketball opponents announcement and Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary are niche stories with limited casual fan interest. Overall, the selection fails to include enough high-profile athletes or teams to engage a broad sports audience.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert's pick, a UFC commentator's return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury update. None of these stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and they do not have significant casual fan interest. The selection includes multiple routine updates and niche sports stories, which do not generate widespread interest. The lack of high-profile stories results in a low overall relevance score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and broad appeal. The stories include a PGA expert&#39;s pick, a UFC commentator&#39;s return, a college basketball schedule announcement, a routine NFL team update, and an MLB injury update. None of these stories feature Tier 1 or Tier 2 stars or teams, and they do not have significant casual fan interest. The selection includes multiple routine updates and niche sports stories, which do not generate widespread interest. The lack of high-profile stories results in a low overall relevance score.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton involve prominent MLB teams and players, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and involve high-profile teams and players. J.J. Spaun's U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a golf story with less starpower prevents a perfect score.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes stories with significant starpower and casual fan interest. The Red Sox trading Rafael Devers and the Yankees activating Giancarlo Stanton involve prominent MLB teams and players, appealing to a broad audience. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup and the uncertainty around Tyrese Haliburton in the NBA Finals are timely and involve high-profile teams and players. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, while notable, lacks the same level of starpower as the other stories. Overall, 4 out of 5 stories have strong relevance, but the inclusion of a golf story with less starpower prevents a perfect score.&quot;

The U.S. Open golf win is a major event, but J.J. Spaun is not a household name, so starpower is moderate. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is timely and has some national interest, but unless it includes major NHL stars (not specified), it lacks starpower. There are no major penalties, but the selection has notable weak spots in terms of starpower and casual fan appeal.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

Only the Simone Biles story (major star, cross-sport appeal) and possibly the Chicago Sky/Angel Reese story (rising WNBA star, but the focus is on Vandersloot's injury) have notable relevance. The Cardinals minicamp update is a routine personnel story with no major stars mentioned. The Katie Boulter tennis win is a minor result with little broad appeal, and the Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer is a niche college baseball story.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Rafael Devers trade (major MLB star, big market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features stars and a major event), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (household name, major team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major golf event but Spaun himself is not a household name, making it slightly weaker in starpower. However, the U.S. Open itself is a premier event with casual fan interest. Overall, this is a very strong selection with only a minor weak spot.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Rafael Devers trade (major MLB star, big market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, features stars and a major event), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, NBA Finals), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (household name, major team). The fifth story, J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open, is a major golf event but Spaun himself is not a household name, making it slightly weaker in starpower. However, the U.S. Open itself is a premier event with casual fan interest. Overall, this is a very strong selection with only a minor weak spot.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (254) has strong starpower and broad appeal due to names like Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun (218) is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, and the drama is limited for casual fans. The Travelers Championship pick (250) is a niche gambling story about a non-star golfer. The Oklahoma SEC opponents (244) is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return (240) is a niche broadcasting note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (250, 244, 240) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains several stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. Only the Duke freshmen ranking (254) has strong starpower and broad appeal due to names like Zion Williamson and Cooper Flagg. The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun (218) is a major event, but Spaun himself is not a household name, and the drama is limited for casual fans. The Travelers Championship pick (250) is a niche gambling story about a non-star golfer. The Oklahoma SEC opponents (244) is a minor college basketball scheduling update with little broad interest. The Michael Bisping UFC commentary return (240) is a niche broadcasting note, not a major sports headline. At least three stories (250, 244, 240) have minimal starpower and limited appeal, triggering a harsh penalty per the guidelines.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship story focuses on Robert MacIntyre, who is not a household name. The UFC story is about Michael Bisping returning to commentary, not a major fight or star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a routine schedule update for a non-premier college basketball program. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach's opinion, not a major NFL star or dramatic development. The Astros' Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher who is not a superstar. At least three stories (Oklahoma SEC, Bisping commentary, McCullers injury) have minimal starpower and little broad appeal, triggering a harsh penalty.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Most of the selected stories lack major starpower or broad casual fan interest. The Travelers Championship story focuses on Robert MacIntyre, who is not a household name. The UFC story is about Michael Bisping returning to commentary, not a major fight or star. The Oklahoma SEC opponents announcement is a routine schedule update for a non-premier college basketball program. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is about a rookie QB and a coach&#39;s opinion, not a major NFL star or dramatic development. The Astros&#39; Lance McCullers Jr. injury is a routine personnel update for a pitcher who is not a superstar. At least three stories (Oklahoma SEC, Bisping commentary, McCullers injury) have minimal starpower and little broad appeal, triggering a harsh penalty.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, recent and dramatic), Tyrese Haliburton's injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, high-stakes game), and Giancarlo Stanton's return for the Yankees (superstar, iconic franchise). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself lacks household name status, making it the weakest of the five. However, the event's prestige compensates somewhat. Overall, this is a strong, timely, and relevant selection for sports fans, but not quite perfect due to the lack of a true superstar in the golf story.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a\ncollection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of\nthe 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player/Team Starpower &amp; Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical**: Focus on the WEAKEST stories in the selection. A few good stories cannot compensate for multiple poor choices.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest  \n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n\n## Penalty Guidelines\n\n**Apply harsh penalties when selections include:**\n- **2+ minor conference/college stories** (automatic -2 or worse)\n- **2+ routine injury/personnel updates** (automatic -2 or worse)  \n- **3+ stories with minimal starpower** (automatic -3)\n- **Multiple international/niche sports** without major stars (automatic -1 or worse)\n\n## Starpower Hierarchy (for reference)\n\n**Tier 1 (Major Stars)**: LeBron, Brady, Mahomes, Ohtani, etc.\n**Tier 2 (Prominent)**: All-Stars, major team players, Olympic medalists\n**Tier 3 (Moderate)**: Starting players on major teams, rising prospects\n**Tier 4 (Low)**: Bench players, minor college athletes, conference-level stars\n**Tier 5 (Minimal)**: Transfer portal moves, minor league, backup players&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: 2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;Four of the five stories have strong starpower and broad appeal: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major MLB star, big market teams), Panthers winning the Stanley Cup (NHL championship, recent and dramatic), Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status for the NBA Finals (star player, high-stakes game), and Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return for the Yankees (superstar, iconic franchise). The U.S. Open win by J.J. Spaun is a major event, but Spaun himself lacks household name status, making it the weakest of the five. However, the event&#39;s prestige compensates somewhat. Overall, this is a strong, timely, and relevant selection for sports fans, but not quite perfect due to the lack of a true superstar in the golf story.&quot;

The NBA Finals game involving the Pacers and Thunder is a high-interest event for basketball fans. Giancarlo Stanton's return is notable due to his prominence, though it's a routine injury return.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

Spaun. These stories have high starpower and casual fan interest, covering major sports events and prominent athletes, making them highly appealing to sports fans.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

Spaun's U.S. Open victory, which is a major golf event with high starpower. However, the other stories significantly lack starpower and casual fan interest. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is low in relevance, as it is not a major tournament. The ranking of Duke freshmen, while featuring notable names like Zion Williamson, is more niche and lacks broad appeal. The announcement of Oklahoma's SEC basketball opponents is routine and administrative, offering little interest to casual fans. Lastly, Michael Bisping's return for UFC commentary is trivial and lacks starpower. Overall, the selection is dominated by stories with low relevance, leading to a score of -2.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection includes one highly relevant story with J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open victory, which is a major golf event with high starpower. However, the other stories significantly lack starpower and casual fan interest. The PGA expert pick for the Travelers Championship is low in relevance, as it is not a major tournament. The ranking of Duke freshmen, while featuring notable names like Zion Williamson, is more niche and lacks broad appeal. The announcement of Oklahoma&#39;s SEC basketball opponents is routine and administrative, offering little interest to casual fans. Lastly, Michael Bisping&#39;s return for UFC commentary is trivial and lacks starpower. Overall, the selection is dominated by stories with low relevance, leading to a score of -2.&quot;

The stories include a PGA expert pick, a UFC commentator update, a college basketball schedule announcement, a speculative NFL coaching comment, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams, and they do not offer significant casual fan interest. The selection is dominated by routine and administrative content with zero household names, which mandates a score of -3.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection of stories lacks major starpower and relevance for casual sports fans. The stories include a PGA expert pick, a UFC commentator update, a college basketball schedule announcement, a speculative NFL coaching comment, and an MLB injury report. None of these stories feature major stars or high-profile teams, and they do not offer significant casual fan interest. The selection is dominated by routine and administrative content with zero household names, which mandates a score of -3.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection of stories is highly relevant and features major stars and teams. The U.S. Open victory by J.J. Spaun is a major golf event with high starpower. The trade of Rafael Devers, an All-Star, is a significant MLB story. The Panthers winning the Stanley Cup is a major NHL event. Tyrese Haliburton's injury status in the NBA Finals is relevant due to the high stakes of the game. Giancarlo Stanton's return to the Yankees is notable due to his star status. All stories have strong casual fan interest and timeliness, making this a well-rounded selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection includes two highly relevant stories: the Red Sox trading All-Star Rafael Devers (major star/team, high interest) and J.J. Spaun winning the U.S. Open (golf major, always tier 1). Giancarlo Stanton's return is a routine injury update, which is low interest despite his starpower. The Pacers vs. Thunder NBA Finals Game 5 would be highly relevant, but this story is not present in the original article list, so it appears fabricated or mismatched. The U.S. hockey Olympic roster announcement is a minor update with no household names. Overall, 2 stories are top-tier, 1 is routine but features a star, and 2 are weak or not present in the source, so the selection has notable weak spots.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles story involves a major star, but the content is a trivial apology/social media controversy, which is explicitly penalized. The Chicago Sky story is about a WNBA team (not a top-tier league for casual fans) and focuses on an injury to a non-household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a non-household name in a non-major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a minor college baseball update. At least three stories (minicamp, transfer portal, Boulter) are low starpower, and the Biles story is trivial despite her fame.

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains multiple stories with low starpower and limited casual fan interest. The Simone Biles story involves a major star, but the content is a trivial apology/social media controversy, which is explicitly penalized. The Chicago Sky story is about a WNBA team (not a top-tier league for casual fans) and focuses on an injury to a non-household name. The Cardinals minicamp story is a routine personnel update with no major stars. The Katie Boulter tennis story features a non-household name in a non-major event. The Southern Conference Pitcher of the Year transfer portal story is a minor college baseball update. At least three stories (minicamp, transfer portal, Boulter) are low starpower, and the Biles story is trivial despite her fame. This fits the criteria for -2: most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, with few redeeming stories.&quot;

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five stories feature major stars, teams, or events with high casual fan interest. The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an All-Star and two prominent MLB teams (Red Sox, Giants). The Panthers&#39; Stanley Cup win is a major championship moment. Tyrese Haliburton&#39;s injury status is highly relevant as it impacts the NBA Finals. Giancarlo Stanton&#39;s return is notable for the Yankees, a marquee franchise, and a household name. J.J. Spaun&#39;s U.S. Open win is a golf major, which is tier 1 content. All stories are timely, involve household names or major events, and are strong conversation topics for sports fans.&quot;

The rest are weak: a PGA expert pick (routine, low starpower), a Duke freshmen ranking (some interest due to Zion/Flagg but not a major news event), Oklahoma SEC basketball schedule (routine, administrative, low starpower), and a UFC commentator's return (niche, not a household name event). There are at least three stories with little to no starpower or casual fan interest, triggering a -2 per the guidelines. The U.S. Open win is strong, but the rest are notably weak.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -2,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;The selection contains only one story with true tier 1 starpower and broad appeal: the U.S. Open major win (J.J. Spaun). The rest are weak: a PGA expert pick (routine, low starpower), a Duke freshmen ranking (some interest due to Zion/Flagg but not a major news event), Oklahoma SEC basketball schedule (routine, administrative, low starpower), and a UFC commentator&#39;s return (niche, not a household name event). There are at least three stories with little to no starpower or casual fan interest, triggering a -2 per the guidelines. The U.S. Open win is strong, but the rest are notably weak.&quot;

                      <div class="message-content" style="margin-top: 10px;">All five stories lack major starpower and broad appeal. The PGA expert pick is a routine prediction, not a major win, and features a non-household name (Robert MacIntyre). The UFC commentator story is administrative and not about a star athlete or major fight. The Oklahoma SEC schedule announcement is a routine college basketball update with no star players or teams involved. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is a minor personnel/development note about a rookie and a coach, not a headline event. The Astros injury update is a routine MLB injury report about a non-star pitcher. This selection is dominated by routine, administrative, and niche stories with zero household names or high casual fan interest, triggering the mandatory -3.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;score&quot;: -3,
  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five stories lack major starpower and broad appeal. The PGA expert pick is a routine prediction, not a major win, and features a non-household name (Robert MacIntyre). The UFC commentator story is administrative and not about a star athlete or major fight. The Oklahoma SEC schedule announcement is a routine college basketball update with no star players or teams involved. The Broncos/Bo Nix story is a minor personnel/development note about a rookie and a coach, not a headline event. The Astros injury update is a routine MLB injury report about a non-star pitcher. This selection is dominated by routine, administrative, and niche stories with zero household names or high casual fan interest, triggering the mandatory -3.&quot;

The U.S. Open win is a golf major (tier 1, household name event). The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises. The Panthers' Stanley Cup win is a championship moment. Haliburton's injury status is highly relevant as it directly impacts the NBA Finals. Stanton's return involves a household name and the Yankees, a marquee team. Every story is timely, features high starpower, and would interest casual fans. This is an ideal selection.</div>

      &quot;content&quot;: &quot;# Sports Relevance Grader V2\n\n# Grader Base Deck\n\nYou are a **grading assistant** who will help us understand whether text\nprovided from an assistant and a user matches the grade you expect. You&#39;ll be\nevaluating the assistant responses based on criteria which we&#39;ll explain in a\nsecond. Your primary objective is to help the person who reads your summary\nunderstand if the assistant&#39;s response correctly matches the criteria provided.\n\n## Grading process\n\n1. You&#39;ll receive a sample which includes a user message and an assistant\n   response.\n2. Look through the provided evaluation criteria and see how well it fits the\n   criteria.\n3. You should provide back a score ranging from -3 (the opposite of the goal)\n   and +3 (the best possible example of the goal.)\n4. If you&#39;re unable to understand how to grade something, because it doesn&#39;t\n   seem to apply, return 0 as the score. Only return 0 if the result is invalid,\n   otherwise provide your best estimation.\n\n### Output Format\n\nReturn your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n- score: number between -3 and 3 (overall score)\n- reason: string explaining the overall evaluation\n- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text\n\n\n\n\n## Specific Task\n\nYou are evaluating a sports news curator&#39;s selection of 5 stories from a collection of sports articles. Your task is to grade the overall relevance of the 5 selected stories as a group, focusing on whether they represent the most\nrelevant stories for sports fans.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nEvaluate the 5 selected stories based on:\n\n1. **Player Starpower &amp; Team Prominence** (highest weight)\n   - Major stars, superstar athletes, household names (e.g., LeBron, Brady, Mahomes)\n   - Prominent teams (e.g., Yankees, Lakers, Cowboys vs. smaller market teams)\n   - High-profile franchises and players that generate widespread interest\n   - **Golf majors are TIER 1**: U.S. Open, Masters, PGA Championship, British Open\n     winners have HIGH starpower and broad appeal - NEVER penalize major wins\n   - **U.S. Open victories are HOUSEHOLD NAME events**: Treat golf major wins exactly\n     like MLB All-Star trades or NBA Finals - they are water cooler moments\n   - **Golf expert picks/predictions are LOW starpower**: Distinguish between major\n     tournament victories (tier 1) and routine PGA predictions/analysis (penalty)\n   - **Be strict**: Stories about minor players, college transfers, or truly niche\n     sports have LOW starpower\n   - **Critical**: Star power DOES NOT redeem trivial stories - even major stars\n     apologizing or other non-substantive content should be penalized\n\n2. **Casual Fan Interest** (medium weight)\n   - Stories that make good conversation topics for mild sports fans\n   - Dramatic, surprising, or easily understood storylines\n   - Cross-sport appeal and general entertainment value\n   - **Avoid over-crediting**: Routine updates, injury returns, and minor\n     personnel moves have LOW interest\n\n3. **Timeliness** (lower weight, should be inherently present)\n   - Breaking news and recent developments\n   - Current relevance to ongoing seasons/events\n\n## Scoring Guide\n\n**Critical Rule**: Judge by the WEAKEST stories. One superstar cannot save a selection with multiple weak stories.\n\n- **+3**: All 5 stories feature major stars/teams AND have high casual fan interest\n- **+2**: 4+ stories have genuine starpower/prominence AND strong interest\n- **+1**: 3+ stories have decent relevance, but selection has notable weak spots\n- **0**: Mixed bag with both strong and weak stories, neither clearly good nor bad\n- **-1**: 2+ stories lack starpower/prominence, overall selection below average\n- **-2**: Most stories are minor/niche with little broad appeal, few redeeming stories\n- **-3**: Nearly all stories are irrelevant to casual fans, poor starpower throughout\n  **MANDATORY -3**: When selection has 4+ routine/administrative stories (expert picks,\n  schedules, injury reports, personnel news) with zero household names\n\n## Instant Negative Triggers\n\n**If a selection contains ANY of these patterns, use negative scores:**\n- **2+ college/minor conference stories** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Transfer portal + routine injury story** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse  \n- **3+ stories about non-household names** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n- **Multiple niche/international sports without stars** ‚Üí automatic -1 or worse\n- **Trivial stories featuring major stars in low-tier sports** ‚Üí automatic -2 or worse\n  (e.g., Simone Biles apologizing, tennis player social media drama)\n- **4+ routine/niche stories with zero household names** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n- **Selection dominated by expert picks, commentator news, schedules, injury reports** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (includes PGA expert picks, fantasy advice, betting predictions)\n- **ALL FIVE STORIES are administrative/routine content** ‚Üí MANDATORY -3\n  (This synthetic sample with PGA pick + UFC commentator + schedule + routine update + injury report\n  is the PERFECT example of what deserves -3, not -2)\n\n## Examples of LOW starpower (should trigger penalties)\n- Transfer portal moves, minor league players\n- Conference-level awards, backup players\n- Routine injury returns, minicamp updates\n- Lesser-known international athletes\n- **Trivial celebrity stories**: Apologies, social media posts, minor controversies\n  involving stars from lower-tier sports (gymnastics, tennis, etc.)\n- **Nothing stories with star names**: Even major athletes cannot redeem\n  substantively empty content\n- **CRITICAL**: Golf majors are NOT low starpower - U.S. Open victories are tier 1 content\n- **DO NOT PENALIZE**: Any selection for including a golf major win - they have\n  equivalent starpower to MLB trades, NBA Finals stories, Stanley Cup wins&quot;

  &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;All five stories feature major stars, teams, or events with high casual fan interest. The U.S. Open win is a golf major (tier 1, household name event). The Devers trade is a blockbuster involving an MLB All-Star and two prominent franchises. The Panthers&#39; Stanley Cup win is a championship moment. Haliburton&#39;s injury status is highly relevant as it directly impacts the NBA Finals. Stanton&#39;s return involves a household name and the Yankees, a marquee team. Every story is timely, features high starpower, and would interest casual fans. This is an ideal selection.&quot;
