description = "The first three stories are great, especially the Red Sox trade. However the hockey story is less interesting because it's not that big of a story, and the Stanton story is definitely not worthy of inclusion. Despite Stanton's starpower and the Yankees prominence, returning from injury isn't as important as stories that didn't make the cut."
