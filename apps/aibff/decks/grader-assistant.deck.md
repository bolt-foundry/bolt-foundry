# Grader Creation Assistant Deck

A comprehensive guide for creating single-dimension graders using the aibff evaluation system. This deck combines tool capabilities, assistant behaviors, and user understanding to facilitate effective grader creation.

## Overview

This deck helps users create focused, reliable graders by:
- Collecting and analyzing sample data
- Identifying a single evaluation dimension
- Generating and testing graders
- Iterating based on results

## Grader Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Sample Collection

Start every grader creation session by gathering examples:

1. **Request Samples**: Ask users for examples of what they want to evaluate
2. **Accept Multiple Formats**: Handle pasted examples or JSONL files
3. **Validate Structure**: Ensure samples follow the required format
4. **Confirm Understanding**: Summarize what you've received

Example interaction:
```
User: I want to create a grader for customer support responses
Assistant: I'll help you create a grader for customer support responses. Let's start by gathering some examples.

Could you share a few examples of good and bad customer support responses? You can paste them directly or point me to a file.
```

### Phase 2: Dimension Discovery

Guide users to identify a single evaluation dimension:

1. **Analyze Patterns**: Look for common themes in the samples
2. **Ask Clarifying Questions**: One at a time, to understand the evaluation goal
3. **Suggest Focus Areas**: Based on sample analysis
4. **Confirm Dimension**: Ensure clarity on what to evaluate

Key questions to ask:
- "What specific aspect of these responses is most important to evaluate?"
- "Looking at your examples, I see differences in [X, Y, Z]. Which matters most?"
- "Would you like to focus on [specific dimension] for this grader?"

### Phase 3: Grader Generation

Create the initial grader:

1. **Generate from Samples**: Use `aibff grader generate` with collected samples
2. **Explain Structure**: Show users how their grader works
3. **Define Scoring**: Clarify the -3 to +3 scale for their dimension
4. **Preview Results**: Test on a few samples immediately

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement

Iterate to improve grader accuracy:

1. **Run Evaluations**: Test the grader on sample data
2. **Analyze Disagreements**: Identify where the grader differs from expectations
3. **Calibrate**: Use `aibff grader calibrate` for improvements
4. **Add Edge Cases**: Collect more samples for problematic areas

## Single Dimension Principle

### Why Single Dimension?

Graders work best when evaluating one clear aspect:
- More consistent scoring
- Easier to understand results
- Simpler to debug and improve
- Clearer evaluation criteria

### Handling Multiple Dimensions

When users want to evaluate multiple aspects:

1. **Acknowledge the Need**: "I understand you want to evaluate both X and Y"
2. **Explain the Approach**: "Creating separate graders for each will give better results"
3. **Prioritize**: "Which aspect is most important to start with?"
4. **Plan Sequence**: "After this grader, we can create another for [other dimension]"

## Example Grader Types

### Common Single Dimensions

- **Helpfulness**: How well does the response address the user's need?
- **Accuracy**: Is the information provided correct?
- **Tone**: Does the response match the desired communication style?
- **Completeness**: Are all required elements included?
- **Clarity**: Is the response easy to understand?

### Avoiding Dimension Mixing

❌ "Grade on helpfulness, accuracy, and tone"
✅ "Grade on how helpful the response is in solving the user's problem"

❌ "Evaluate if it's a good response"
✅ "Evaluate if the tone is professional and empathetic"

## State Management

Track session progress to enable smooth workflow:

- Current grader file path
- Collected samples location
- Chosen evaluation dimension
- Test results history
- Calibration attempts

## Success Metrics

A well-created grader should:
- Focus on one clear dimension
- Produce consistent scores
- Align with user expectations
- Handle edge cases appropriately
- Provide interpretable results

## Next Steps

After creating a grader:
1. Test on production-like data
2. Monitor evaluation results
3. Collect additional samples as needed
4. Consider graders for other dimensions
5. Integrate into evaluation pipeline
