# Collector Project Plan

## Project Purpose

We're building a system that captures and processes OpenAI SDK calls and
responses. This system will allow us to perform transformations and analytics on
the collected data to provide valuable insights for AI applications.

## User Personas

- **ML Engineers**: Need to analyze patterns in API usage to optimize costs
- **Product Managers**: Want to understand how users interact with AI features
- **Developers**: Need to debug and trace AI interactions in their applications

## Version Overview

### Version 0.1: Foundation

- Move posthog logic from frontend bolt-foundry package to the collector backend
- Mirror posthog API keys for authentication initially
- Build basic data collection pipeline

### Version 0.2: Identity Management

- Create our own API key generation and management system
- Implement identity and behavior card building on a callsite-by-callsite basis
- Add metadata injection capabilities for request control

### Version 0.3: Advanced Controls

- Develop header specifications for privacy controls (e.g., "don't save message
  content")
- Implement request filtering capabilities (e.g., "don't send this request")
- Add advanced analytics dashboards

## Success Metrics

- Clear identity and behavior tracking for each API interaction
- Improved debugging capabilities for API-driven features

## User Journeys

1. A developer integrates the bolt-foundry package, which automatically forwards
   API interactions to the collector
2. The collector processes and stores the data according to privacy settings
3. The developer can view analytics and traces of their application's AI
   interactions
4. ML Engineers can analyze patterns to optimize costs and performance

## Testing Strategy

- End-to-end tests with sample applications
- Performance testing under high load conditions
- Privacy control verification to ensure sensitive data isn't collected when
  specified

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Data Privacy**: Implement robust header controls and default privacy
  settings
- **Performance Impact**: Optimize collection pipeline to minimize latency
- **Scalability**: Design system to handle growth in API traffic volume
