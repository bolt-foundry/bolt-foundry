# Collector Project Status

**Current Status:** COMPLETE (v0.0.1) âœ…

## Status Details

The Collector project has completed its initial implementation phase. While
functional for current needs, it will be expanded as part of future product
roadmap initiatives.

## Current State

The project has successfully delivered:

- Initial planning and architecture design
- Basic API interception capabilities
- Integration points with existing systems
- Foundation for future analytics expansion

## Future Plans

The Collector is part of our broader product vision but not a current priority.
Future enhancements will include:

- Advanced analytics capabilities aligned with product roadmap
- Enhanced data collection based on updated vision
- Expanded integration with the evolving bolt-foundry ecosystem

Updates to this project will resume once:

1. Product vision updates are finalized
2. Specific analytics requirements are defined for new features
3. Priority shifts to analytics and observability initiatives

## Related Components

While the Collector project is on hold, any dependencies on this system should
be handled as follows:

- Frontend analytics: Continue using direct PostHog integration
- LLM metrics: Use existing bolt-foundry package capabilities
- API tracking: Implement temporary solutions within application code
