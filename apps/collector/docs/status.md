# Collector Project Status

**Current Status:** PAUSED (May 15, 2025)

## Status Details

The Collector project has been temporarily paused pending a broader product
strategy reconsideration. The initial approach to capturing OpenAI SDK calls and
managing analytics through PostHog will be re-evaluated as part of this process.

## Reason for Pause

1. Need to align with evolving product strategy
2. Potential architectural changes to the analytics approach
3. Re-evaluation of data collection requirements

## Current Progress

Before the pause, the project had:

- Completed initial planning and architecture design
- Established basic requirements for API interception
- Defined integration points with existing systems

## Resumption Criteria

The project will be reconsidered for resumption after:

1. Completion of product strategy revision
2. Clear definition of analytics requirements
3. Determination of the appropriate technical approach

## Related Components

While the Collector project is paused, any dependencies on this system should be
handled as follows:

- Frontend analytics: Continue using direct PostHog integration
- LLM metrics: Use existing bolt-foundry package capabilities
- API tracking: Implement temporary solutions within application code
