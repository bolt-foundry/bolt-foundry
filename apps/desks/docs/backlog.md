# Desks Application - Backlog

This document tracks the Desks application which has been deprioritized from
active development.

## Project Overview

Desks is a persistent video conferencing application for iPad that aims to:

- Create persistent conference spaces for team members
- Enable video-on, audio-off ambient presence
- Provide a "knock" feature for initiating conversations
- Create a sense of shared space for remote teams

## Current Status

The project has been moved to backlog status as of [current date] to prioritize
other initiatives.

## Preserved Resources

- Project Plan: [project-plan.md](./project-plan.md)
- Implementation Plans:
  - [implementation-plan.md](./implementation-plan.md)
  - [0.2/implementation-plan.md](./0.2/implementation-plan.md)
  - [0.3/implementation-plan.md](./0.3/implementation-plan.md)

## Future Considerations

When revisiting this project, consider:

1. Reevaluating the technical approach based on current infrastructure
2. Reassessing market need and team requirements for remote collaboration
3. Reviewing whether iPad-specific optimization is still the right approach
