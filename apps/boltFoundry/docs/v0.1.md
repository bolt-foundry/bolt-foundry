# v0.1 Documentation Implementation Plan

## Overview

Version 0.1 delivers a minimal documentation system that enables developers to
self-serve through installation and first usage of Bolt Foundry. The focus is on
creating the technical infrastructure to serve MDX documentation through
Isograph, with a quickstart guide that demonstrates the value proposition
through a concrete JSON output reliability example.

## Goals

| Goal             | Description                       | Success Criteria                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| MDX via Isograph | Serve docs at `/docs/*` routes    | MDX files render correctly at boltfoundry.com/docs/x  |
| Clear value demo | Show JSON reliability improvement | Quickstart includes before/after example with context |

## Anti-Goals

| Anti-Goal            | Reason                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| API reference        | Focus on getting started first        |
| Advanced patterns    | Keep it simple for v0.1               |
| Multiple use cases   | Focus only on JSON output reliability |
| Interactive features | No CodeSandbox, just static examples  |

## Technical Approach

Extend the existing MDX infrastructure to serve documentation through Isograph.
Create a single entrypoint (`EntrypointDocs.ts`) that dynamically loads MDX
files based on the route path. Documentation files will live in the `docs/`
directory and be processed during the build pipeline to the appropriate location
for serving.

## Components

| Status | Component               | Purpose                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [x]    | ~~`EntrypointDocs.ts`~~ | ~~Isograph entrypoint for all docs routes~~ |
| [x]    | `DocsPage.tsx`          | Direct route component for docs pages       |
| [x]    | `docs/` directory       | Store MDX documentation files               |
| [x]    | Build pipeline updates  | Process docs during content build           |
| [x]    | Route registration      | Add `/docs/*` to direct routes              |

## Technical Decisions

| Decision                   | Reasoning                    | Alternatives Considered        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Single Isograph entrypoint | Simpler, dynamic routing     | Individual entrypoints per doc |
| Reuse MDX infrastructure   | Already built and tested     | Custom markdown processor      |
| `/docs/` location          | Clear separation of docs     | `/content/docs/` subdirectory  |
| Minimal MDX features       | Ship faster, add later       | Full-featured from start       |
| Static build-time imports  | Works with ESBuild/Isograph  | Dynamic runtime loading        |
| Import map generation      | Automatic, maintainable      | Manual imports for each doc    |
| `__generated__/` location  | Follows codebase conventions | Component-local generation     |

## Next Steps

| Question                | How to Explore                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| MDX component styling   | Test with existing blog styles first      |
| Navigation between docs | Start with manual links, auto-gen later   |
| Search functionality    | Not needed for v0.1, revisit if requested |

## Initial Content Structure

```
docs/
├── quickstart.mdx       # Installation + JSON example
└── getting-started.mdx  # Theory + first structured prompt
```

## Implementation Notes

### Build-Time Import Map Generation

The docs system uses static build-time imports due to ESBuild/Isograph
architecture:

1. MDX files in `/docs/` are compiled during build
2. An import map is generated at
   `apps/boltFoundry/__generated__/docsImportMap.ts`
3. The Docs component statically imports all docs via the generated map
4. Route slugs map to pre-imported components (no dynamic loading)

This approach ensures type safety, build-time validation, and optimal
performance.

## Implementation Checklist (TDD Approach)

### 0.1.0: Write Tests First

- [x] Update `infra/appBuild/__tests__/contentBuild.test.ts` to expect `/docs/`
      processing (tests written)
- [x] Create simple E2E test expecting `/docs` route to load successfully

### 0.1.1: Infrastructure (Make Tests Pass)

- [x] Create `apps/boltFoundry/pages/DocsPage.tsx` (direct routing component)
- [x] Update `infra/appBuild/contentBuild.ts` to:
  - Process `/docs/` directory
  - Generate import map at `apps/boltFoundry/__generated__/docsImportMap.ts`
  - Compile MDX files to ES modules
- [x] Register `/docs` and `/docs/:slug` routes in direct routes configuration
- [x] Fix runtime rendering by bypassing Isograph for documentation pages
- [x] Implement slug-to-import-key conversion (hyphens to underscores)

### 0.1.2: Content

- [x] Create `docs/quickstart.mdx` with:
  - Installation instructions
  - JSON output reliability example
  - Before/after comparison
  - Context block usage
- [x] Create `docs/getting-started.mdx` with theoretical foundation

### 0.1.3: Verify & Polish

- [x] Run all tests to ensure implementation is complete
- [x] Manual verification of content rendering
- [x] Ensure routes work in production build

## Success Metrics

- Developers can find and access docs at boltfoundry.com/docs
- Quickstart demonstrates clear value through JSON example
- Documentation infrastructure ready for expansion

## Current Status & Next Steps

### What's Working

- MDX to JS compilation at build time
- Route recognition and parameter extraction (`/docs/:slug`)
- Import map generation with all documentation files
- E2E test infrastructure (with relaxed assertions)

### Current Blocker

The runtime rendering fails when trying to display MDX content through Isograph.
The error occurs in the `BfIsographFragmentReader` component when attempting to
render the documentation.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix Isograph Integration (Option A)**
   - Add proper GraphQL type for Docs (not just a field on Query)
   - Update schema to handle document queries with parameters
   - Fix parameter passing chain: router → entrypoint → component
   - Ensure MDX components can render within Isograph's fragment system

2. **Bypass Isograph for Docs (Option B - Faster)**
   - Create a separate route handler for `/docs/*` that doesn't use Isograph
   - Render MDX components directly without GraphQL layer
   - Similar to how `/ui`, `/justin`, and `/plinko` routes work
   - Would be simpler but less consistent with the app's architecture

3. **Once Rendering Works**
   - Add `/docs` root route with documentation index
   - Implement syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
   - Create navigation sidebar
   - Style documentation pages to match design system

### Technical Debt Considerations

- Current implementation tries to force MDX rendering through GraphQL/Isograph
- This may be over-engineering for static documentation
- Consider if docs need the full Isograph treatment or if simpler routing would
  suffice
