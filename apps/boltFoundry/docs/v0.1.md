# v0.1 Documentation Implementation Plan

## Overview

Version 0.1 delivers a minimal documentation system that enables developers to
self-serve through installation and first usage of Bolt Foundry. The focus is on
creating the technical infrastructure to serve MDX documentation through
Isograph, with a quickstart guide that demonstrates the value proposition
through a concrete JSON output reliability example.

## Goals

| Goal             | Description                       | Success Criteria                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| MDX via Isograph | Serve docs at `/docs/*` routes    | MDX files render correctly at boltfoundry.com/docs/x  |
| Clear value demo | Show JSON reliability improvement | Quickstart includes before/after example with context |

## Anti-Goals

| Anti-Goal            | Reason                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| API reference        | Focus on getting started first        |
| Advanced patterns    | Keep it simple for v0.1               |
| Multiple use cases   | Focus only on JSON output reliability |
| Interactive features | No CodeSandbox, just static examples  |

## Technical Approach

Extend the existing MDX infrastructure to serve documentation through Isograph.
Create a single entrypoint (`EntrypointDocs.ts`) that dynamically loads MDX
files based on the route path. This maintains consistency with the blog system
while allowing docs to live at predictable URLs that mirror the app structure.

## Components

| Status | Component                 | Purpose                                 |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [ ]    | `EntrypointDocs.ts`       | Isograph entrypoint for all docs routes |
| [ ]    | `content/docs/` directory | Store MDX documentation files           |
| [ ]    | `Docs.tsx` resolver       | Render MDX content with basic styling   |
| [ ]    | Build pipeline updates    | Process docs during content build       |
| [ ]    | Route registration        | Add `/docs/*` to Isograph routes        |

## Technical Decisions

| Decision                   | Reasoning                    | Alternatives Considered        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Single Isograph entrypoint | Simpler, dynamic routing     | Individual entrypoints per doc |
| Reuse MDX infrastructure   | Already built and tested     | Custom markdown processor      |
| `/content/docs/` location  | Consistent with blog pattern | `/docs/` at root               |
| Minimal MDX features       | Ship faster, add later       | Full-featured from start       |

## Next Steps

| Question                | How to Explore                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| MDX component styling   | Test with existing blog styles first      |
| Navigation between docs | Start with manual links, auto-gen later   |
| Search functionality    | Not needed for v0.1, revisit if requested |

## Initial Content Structure

```
content/docs/
├── quickstart.mdx       # Installation + JSON example
└── getting-started.mdx  # Theory + first structured prompt
```

## Implementation Checklist (TDD Approach)

### 0.1.0: Write Tests First

- [ ] Update `infra/appBuild/__tests__/contentBuild.test.ts` to expect `/content/docs/` processing
- [ ] Create simple E2E test expecting `/docs` route to load successfully

### 0.1.1: Infrastructure (Make Tests Pass)

- [ ] Create `apps/boltFoundry/entrypoints/EntrypointDocs.ts`
- [ ] Add Isograph resolver in `apps/boltFoundry/components/Docs.tsx`
- [ ] Update `infra/appBuild/contentBuild.ts` to process `/content/docs/`
- [ ] Register `/docs/*` routes in Isograph configuration
- [ ] Success: Tests pass and render content at `/docs/*`

### 0.1.2: Content

- [ ] Create `content/docs/quickstart.mdx` with:
  - Installation instructions
  - JSON output reliability example
  - Before/after comparison
  - Context block usage
- [ ] Create `content/docs/getting-started.mdx` with theoretical foundation

### 0.1.3: Verify & Polish

- [ ] Run all tests to ensure implementation is complete
- [ ] Manual verification of content rendering
- [ ] Ensure routes work in production build

## Success Metrics

- Developers can find and access docs at boltfoundry.com/docs
- Quickstart demonstrates clear value through JSON example
- Documentation infrastructure ready for expansion
