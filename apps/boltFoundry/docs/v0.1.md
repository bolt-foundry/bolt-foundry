# v0.1 documentation implementation

## Overview

Version 0.1 delivers a documentation system that serves markdown files from the
`/docs/` directory using the `marked` library for markdown rendering. The system
uses Isograph/GraphQL for routing and data fetching, with in-memory caching for
optimal performance.

## Current Implementation

| Component             | Status | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Markdown rendering    | ✅     | Using `marked` library in `Docs.tsx` component |
| Isograph integration  | ✅     | Full GraphQL routing via `EntrypointDocs`      |
| Runtime caching       | ✅     | In-memory cache in `PublishedDocument` class   |
| Server-side rendering | ✅     | React SSR with pre-rendered HTML               |
| File support          | ✅     | Both `.md` and `.mdx` files supported          |

## Architecture

| Layer         | Implementation                                 |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Routing       | `/docs/:slug` → `entrypointDocs` (Isograph)    |
| Entrypoint    | `EntrypointDocs.ts` queries `Query.Docs`       |
| GraphQL Query | `Query.documentsBySlug` resolver in `Query.ts` |
| Data Layer    | `PublishedDocument.findX()` with caching       |
| Rendering     | `Docs.tsx` component using `marked` library    |

## Technical approach

The system uses GraphQL/Isograph for routing and data fetching, with the
`marked` library for markdown rendering. Files are read on-demand and cached in
memory after the first request. This provides excellent performance while
keeping the implementation simple.

## Key Components

| Component           | File Path                        | Purpose                          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Isograph Entrypoint | `entrypoints/EntrypointDocs.ts`  | Route handler for `/docs/:slug`  |
| React Component     | `components/Docs.tsx`            | Renders markdown using `marked`  |
| GraphQL Query       | `graphql/roots/Query.ts`         | `documentsBySlug` resolver       |
| Data Model          | `nodeTypes/PublishedDocument.ts` | File loading and caching logic   |
| Route Registration  | `routes.ts`                      | Maps `/docs/:slug` to entrypoint |

## Technical decisions

| Decision                | Current Implementation | Reasoning                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Use `marked` library    | ✅ Implemented         | Simple, lightweight, reliable          |
| Isograph integration    | ✅ Implemented         | Type-safe routing and data fetching    |
| Server-side rendering   | ✅ Implemented         | Fast initial page loads                |
| `/docs/` directory only | ✅ Current scope       | Focused implementation                 |
| On-demand file reading  | ✅ With caching        | Balance between memory and performance |
| In-memory caching       | ✅ After first request | Eliminate repeated file I/O            |
| Plain markdown + MDX    | ✅ Both supported      | Flexibility for future enhancements    |

## Next steps

| Question                | How to explore                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| MDX component styling   | Test with existing blog styles first      |
| Navigation between docs | Start with manual links, auto-gen later   |
| Search functionality    | Not needed for v0.1, revisit if requested |

## Implementation notes

### Current Architecture

The docs system uses GraphQL/Isograph with runtime caching:

1. User requests `/docs/[slug]` which matches the Isograph route
2. `EntrypointDocs` queries for the document via GraphQL
3. `PublishedDocument.findX()` checks the cache first
4. If not cached, reads the `.md` or `.mdx` file from disk
5. Caches the document instance for future requests
6. `Docs.tsx` component renders markdown using `marked`
7. Client receives pre-rendered HTML via React SSR

This approach provides type safety through GraphQL while maintaining excellent
performance through in-memory caching.

- No errors when navigating to documentation pages

## Current status

### What's implemented ✅

- Isograph/GraphQL routing for `/docs/:slug`
- GraphQL query resolver with document lookup
- In-memory caching after first file read
- Support for both `.md` and `.mdx` files
- Markdown rendering with `marked` library
- React SSR for pre-rendered HTML
- Error handling for missing documents

### Caching implementation

The current `PublishedDocument` implementation uses a
`Map<string, Promise<PublishedDocument>>` cache:

1. **First request**: File is read from disk and cached
2. **Subsequent requests**: Document served from memory cache
3. **Cache persistence**: Maintained for the lifetime of the server process
4. **No pre-warming**: Files are cached on-demand, not at startup

This provides a good balance between memory usage and performance, avoiding the
need to load all documents into memory at startup.
