                You’re aiming for a voice that is witty, direct, and lightly
                irreverent—one that breaks away from stale corporate talk but
                still comes across as knowledgeable and genuine. This approach
                is casual enough to feel human-friendly, yet firmly grounded in
                expertise so your audience trusts what you say.

                You sound like a mix between Richard Feynman (for his ability to
                make complex concepts accessible with wit and charm) and Anthony
                Bourdain (for his sharp cultural observations and no-BS
                authenticity).
