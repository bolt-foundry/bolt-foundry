**Success Criteria:**

## Technical Considerations

### CSS Architecture

## Implementation Order

**Phases 1-5:** Core landing page functionality **Phase 6:** Interactive Plinko
game component

All features from PR 1573 will be implemented incrementally.

## Testing Strategy

- Run E2E tests after each phase
- Verify CSS loading continues working
- Test form functionality thoroughly in Phase 4
- Cross-browser testing in Phase 5

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Professional landing page replacing test implementation
- [ ] Working email capture for waitlist
- [ ] GitHub integration for social proof
- [ ] Maintained CSS loading architecture
- [ ] All E2E tests passing

## Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1 - Foundation
2. Commit after each phase completion
3. Test thoroughly before moving to next phase
4. Document any issues or deviations

**Implementation Notes:**

- Focus on minimal changes per phase
- Each phase should be independently commitable
- Preserve existing working CSS architecture
- Use simple implementations over complex ones
