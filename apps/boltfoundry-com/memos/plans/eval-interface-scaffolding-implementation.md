# Eval Interface Scaffolding Implementation Plan

_Complete UI scaffolding for the evaluation interface with sidebar navigation
and content areas_

**Date**: 2025-07-24\
**Status**: Completed\
**Approach**: Component-based architecture with BfDs integration

## Executive Summary

This plan outlined the implementation of a complete UI scaffolding for the Eval
interface, featuring a responsive three-panel layout with left navigation
sidebar, main content area, and contextual right sidebar. The implementation
leverages the BfDs design system for consistent theming and components, with
proper dark theme integration.

## Implementation Scope: Three-Panel Eval Interface

### Core Layout Components

1. **Left Navigation Sidebar** - Navigation between main content types (Decks,
   Analyze, Chat)
2. **Main Content Area** - Dynamic content display with action buttons
3. **Right Contextual Sidebar** - Context-sensitive details and settings
4. **Responsive Behavior** - Adaptive layout for mobile and desktop

### Success Criteria

- [x] Responsive three-panel layout with proper sidebar behavior
- [x] Left sidebar navigation between Decks, Analyze, and Chat views
- [x] Right sidebar opens with contextual content based on main area actions
- [x] Mobile-responsive overlay behavior for narrow screens
- [x] Integration with BfDs design system and dark theme
- [x] Proper CSS variables usage for consistent theming

## Implementation Status

### ✅ **COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE (COMPLETED)**

- **EvalContext**: React context for managing sidebar states and active content
  - State management for left/right sidebar visibility
  - Active main content tracking (Decks/Analyze/Chat)
  - Right sidebar content management
- **Layout Components**: Modular component structure
  - `LeftSidebar`: Navigation with BfDs buttons for content switching
  - `MainArea`: Dynamic content rendering based on active selection
  - `RightSidebar`: Contextual content with close functionality
  - `EvalContent`: Main wrapper component orchestrating layout

### ✅ **DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION (COMPLETED)**

- **BfDs Components**: Full integration with design system
  - `BfDsButton` for all interactive elements with proper variants
  - `BfDsIcon` integration with correct icon names (`burgerMenu`, `cross`)
  - Consistent button styling and interaction patterns
- **Theme Variables**: Complete CSS variable integration
  - All colors use `var(--bfds-*)` variables from bfDsStyle.css
  - Proper dark theme support with background, text, and border colors
  - Focus states using design system focus colors
- **Custom CSS**: Dedicated evalStyle.css with responsive design
  - Three-panel layout with flexbox architecture
  - Sidebar positioning logic (side-by-side vs overlay)
  - Mobile-first responsive breakpoints

### ✅ **INTERACTION PATTERNS (COMPLETED)**

- **Sidebar Management**: Complete state-driven sidebar behavior
  - Left sidebar toggle with hamburger menu button
  - Right sidebar opens from main area action buttons
  - Proper overlay behavior when both sidebars are active
- **Content Navigation**: Dynamic main content switching
  - Navigation buttons in left sidebar change active content
  - Visual active state indicators on navigation buttons
  - Context-aware right sidebar content based on main area
- **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile-optimized layout
  - Sidebars become overlays on mobile screens
  - Touch-friendly button sizing and spacing
  - Proper z-index layering for mobile interactions

## File Structure

```
apps/boltfoundry-com/
├── components/
│   └── Eval.tsx                    # Main component with all layout logic
├── contexts/
│   └── EvalContext.tsx            # State management context
└── static/
    └── evalStyle.css              # Layout and responsive styles
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern

```typescript
// EvalContext provides centralized state for:
- leftSidebarOpen: boolean
- rightSidebarOpen: boolean  
- rightSidebarContent: string
- activeMainContent: "Decks" | "Analyze" | "Chat"
```

### Responsive Layout Strategy

- **Desktop (>1024px)**: Side-by-side layout with fixed sidebar widths
- **Tablet (768-1024px)**: Reduced sidebar widths, maintained side-by-side
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Full overlay behavior for both sidebars

### Design System Alignment

- All components use BfDs variants and sizing
- CSS variables ensure theme consistency
- Icon usage follows BfDs naming conventions
- Button behaviors match design system patterns

## Next Steps for Content Implementation

### Phase 1: Decks View Implementation

- [ ] Connect to GraphQL data layer for deck listing
- [ ] Implement deck creation and editing forms
- [ ] Add deck detail view in right sidebar

### Phase 2: Analysis View Implementation

- [ ] Build sample submission interface
- [ ] Create results visualization components
- [ ] Implement feedback comparison views

### Phase 3: Chat Interface Integration

- [ ] Integrate with existing chat components
- [ ] Add conversation history management
- [ ] Implement chat-specific right sidebar content

## Lessons Learned

1. **Component Architecture**: The modular approach with separate components for
   each layout section provides excellent maintainability and reusability.

2. **Context Pattern**: Using React context for sidebar state management allows
   clean separation of concerns and easy state access across components.

3. **CSS Variables**: Leveraging the existing BfDs CSS variables ensures
   automatic theme consistency and reduces maintenance overhead.

4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with overlay behavior provides
   optimal UX across all device sizes.

5. **BfDs Integration**: Using the design system components and icons ensures
   consistency with the broader application UI.

## Conclusion

The Eval interface scaffolding is now complete with a robust, responsive
three-panel layout that integrates seamlessly with the BfDs design system. The
architecture provides a solid foundation for implementing the actual evaluation
workflows while maintaining excellent UX patterns across all device sizes.
