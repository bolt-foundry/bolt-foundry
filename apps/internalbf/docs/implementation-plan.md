# InternalBF Implementation Plan

## Overview

InternalBF serves as the core service platform for internal Bolt Foundry
applications and utilities. This implementation plan outlines the technical
approach across all versions, focusing on creating a maintainable and extensible
system for hosting internal services.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **HTTP Server**: Deno-based HTTP server listening on configurable port
2. **Router**: Request router to direct traffic to appropriate service handlers
3. **Service Registry**: Pluggable system for registering new services
4. **Environment Configuration**: Centralized management of environment
   variables
5. **Logging System**: Structured logging for operational monitoring

### Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Deno 2 (TypeScript)
- **HTTP**: Native Deno HTTP server
- **Environment Management**: Using `get-configuration-var` package
- **Logging**: Using Bolt Foundry logger package
- **External Integrations**: Discord.js, Notion client

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0.1: Foundation

1. **Basic Server Setup**:
   - Implement HTTP server with request handler
   - Create routing mechanism for dispatching requests
   - Set up environment variable handling
   - Implement structured logging

2. **Initial Service Integration**:
   - Implement ThanksBot Discord integration
   - Set up Notion database connectivity
   - Create message parsing and handling logic

3. **Desks Integration**:
   - Implement route handling for Desks application
   - Create interface for routing requests to Desks handler

### Phase 0.2: Service Expansion

1. **Service Framework**:
   - Develop standardized service registration pattern
   - Implement service lifecycle management
   - Create service configuration system

2. **Operational Improvements**:
   - Add health check endpoints
   - Implement basic monitoring
   - Create deployment scripts and documentation

3. **Additional Services**:
   - Integrate additional internal tools as needed
   - Implement API endpoints for service management

### Phase 0.3: Advanced Features

1. **Security & Authentication**:
   - Add authentication layer for protected endpoints
   - Implement authorization controls
   - Set up rate limiting and abuse prevention

2. **Dashboard & Monitoring**:
   - Create admin dashboard for service monitoring
   - Implement detailed logging and analytics
   - Set up alerting for service disruptions

3. **Advanced Integration**:
   - Support for additional third-party services
   - Implement webhooks for external system integration
   - Create API documentation system

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual service components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Test service interactions and API endpoints
- **Load Tests**: Verify performance under expected load conditions
- **Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring for production deployments

## Deployment Strategy

- **Development**: Local development using Deno run
- **Testing**: Deployment to staging environment for integration testing
- **Production**: Deployment to production environment with monitoring
- **Rollback**: Procedures for rapid rollback in case of issues

## Documentation

- **Setup Guide**: Instructions for local development environment
- **Service Documentation**: Documentation for each integrated service
- **API Reference**: Reference for any exposed API endpoints
- **Operational Procedures**: Guides for common operational tasks
