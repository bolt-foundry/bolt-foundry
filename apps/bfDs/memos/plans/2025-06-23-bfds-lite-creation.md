# BfDs Creation Plan (formerly BfDs Lite)

**Date**: 2025-06-23\
**Status**: In Progress\
**Author**: Claude

## Overview

Created a new lightweight design system (bfDs) to replace the bloated legacy
design system. Starting with core components and building up incrementally.

**Note**: This was originally created as bfDsLite but has been renamed to bfDs
as part of the 2025-06-25 design system migration.

## Goals

- Create a lightweight alternative to the existing bfDs
- Reduce complexity and bundle size
- Use modern CSS practices (CSS variables, clean class naming)
- Maintain consistent design language
- Easy to extend and maintain

## Design Tokens

### Color Palette

- **Primary**: `#ffd700` (gold)
- **Background**: `#141516` (dark gray)
- **Text**: `#fafaff` (light gray)
- **Secondary**: `#6b7280` (medium gray)

### CSS Variables Structure

- Base colors with hover/active variations
- Semantic naming convention: `--bfds-{color}-{state}`

## Progress

### âœ… Completed

- [x] Created `apps/bfDs` directory structure
- [x] **BfDsButton** component with:
  - 4 variants: primary, secondary, outline, ghost
  - 3 sizes: small, medium, large
  - Hover and active states
  - Disabled state
  - TypeScript types
  - **Icon support**: `icon`, `iconPosition`, `iconOnly` props
  - **Round icon-only buttons**: Perfectly circular design
- [x] **BfDsIcon** component with:
  - 80+ icons from existing bfDs system
  - 3 sizes: small (16px), medium (20px), large (24px)
  - Color customization with CSS variable integration
  - TypeScript-safe icon names using `keyof typeof icons`
  - Searchable example component with grid layout
- [x] **BfDsTabs** component with:
  - Multiple tab support with controlled/uncontrolled modes
  - **Nested subtabs** for hierarchical navigation
  - **Keyboard navigation** (arrow keys, Home/End, Enter/Space)
  - **Icon support** in both main tabs and subtabs
  - **Disabled tab states** with proper styling
  - **Smooth content transitions** with fade-in animations
  - **2 variants** (primary, secondary) and **3 sizes** (small, medium, large)
  - **Comprehensive accessibility** with ARIA attributes and roles
- [x] **BfDsForm** system with smart dual-mode components:
  - **BfDsForm**: Context provider for centralized form state management
  - **BfDsInput**: Text input with
    error/success/disabled/focus/required/placeholder states
  - **BfDsTextArea**: Textarea with resize options and all input states
  - **BfDsFormSubmitButton**: Submit button with form integration
  - **Dual mode operation**: Components auto-detect form context vs standalone
    usage
  - **TypeScript-first**: Strong typing with proper form data integration
  - **Complete accessibility**: ARIA attributes and semantic HTML
- [x] CSS variables system for theming with additional form states (error,
      success, focus)
- [x] Example component pattern (`Component.Example`)
- [x] Demo page setup with Button, Icon, Tabs, and Form examples
- [x] CSS moved to static folder (per system requirements)
- [x] Main index.ts exports with all form components
- [x] Icon library moved to `lib/icons.ts`

## Design Decisions

1. **CSS-in-CSS over CSS-in-JS**: Using external CSS files with CSS variables
   for better performance and easier theming
2. **Component.Example pattern**: Each component has an attached Example
   component for demos
3. **BEM-like naming**: `.bfds-button--variant` for clear CSS class structure
4. **TypeScript-first**: Strong typing for all props and variants using
   `keyof typeof` patterns
5. **Minimal dependencies**: Keeping the design system lightweight
6. **Icon integration**: Seamless icon support in buttons with automatic sizing
   and positioning
7. **Circular icon buttons**: Icon-only buttons use `border-radius: 50%` for
   modern appearance
8. **Inline SVG icons**: Performance-optimized with no HTTP requests, using
   existing icon library
9. **Smart dual-mode components**: Form components automatically detect context
   and adapt between standalone and form-integrated modes
10. **Form state management**: Centralized form context with TypeScript-safe
    data handling and error management

## Next Steps

1. Add more core components following the same patterns (Select, Checkbox,
   Radio, Modal, etc.)
2. Enhance demo page with more interactive examples
3. Document component APIs comprehensively
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Plan migration strategy from legacy design system to bfDs
