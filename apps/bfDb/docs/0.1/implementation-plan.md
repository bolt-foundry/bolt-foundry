# GraphQL Builder v0.1 Implementation Plan

## Summary

We're replacing the legacy three-helper GraphQL DSL with a single-argument
fluent builder pattern that mirrors the successful bfNodeSpec field builder.
This implementation plan outlines the approach, steps, and expected outcomes for
this migration.

## Goals

- Create a more maintainable, type-safe GraphQL schema building system
- Unify our builder patterns (both bfDb and GraphQL using similar fluent
  interfaces)
- Improve developer experience with better type inference and IDE support
- Maintain backward compatibility at the schema level while changing the
  implementation
- Support edge relationships between node types, with an initial focus on the
  BfPerson to BfOrganization relationship for login functionality
- Establish a solid foundation for future enhancements like Relay connections

## Non-Goals

- Changing the GraphQL schema structure (client-facing API remains the same)
- Removing dependency on Nexus/GraphQL Yoga (still used under the hood)
- Implementing Relay-style connections (deprioritized for v0.1)

## Approach

1. **Builder Pattern**: Create a fluent interface similar to bfNodeSpec
2. **Direct Integration**: Map builder specs to Nexus types at build time
3. **Progressive Migration**: Convert nodes one at a time to minimize disruption
4. **Validation**: Add build-time validation against bfNodeSpec.relations
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for builder, Nexus generation, and resolvers

## Implementation Steps

1. **Core Builder Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - Create makeGqlBuilder.ts with fluent interface
   - Implement scalar field methods (.string(), .int(), etc.)
   - Add nullability helpers
   - Create argument builder

2. **Type Generation** üîÑ
   - Create gqlSpecToNexus.ts to map specs to Nexus types
   - Implement field resolver logic with proper fallback chain
   - Handle mapping of arguments

3. **Edge Relationships** üîÑ
   - Implement simple edge relationship between BfPerson and BfOrganization
   - Support "member of" relationship pattern for organization membership
   - Ensure GraphQL schema correctly exposes this relationship

4. **Validation** ‚è±Ô∏è
   - Add validation for object relations against bfNodeSpec.relations
   - Ensure consistency between database and GraphQL schema

5. **Migration** ‚è±Ô∏è
   - Update GraphQLObjectBase.defineGqlNode
   - Convert one example node as proof of concept
   - Migrate remaining nodes
   - Remove legacy builders

6. **Testing** ‚è±Ô∏è
   - Unit tests for builder functionality
   - Tests for Nexus type generation
   - Integration tests for field resolution
   - Tests for edge relationships
   - End-to-end tests with GraphQL queries

## Technical Design

### Builder Interfaces

```typescript
// GqlBuilder interface - main builder for nodes
interface GqlBuilder {
  // Scalar fields
  string(name: string, opts?: FieldOptions): GqlBuilder;
  int(name: string, opts?: FieldOptions): GqlBuilder;
  float(name: string, opts?: FieldOptions): GqlBuilder;
  boolean(name: string, opts?: FieldOptions): GqlBuilder;
  id(name: string, opts?: FieldOptions): GqlBuilder;

  // Relations
  object(name: string, opts?: RelationOptions): GqlBuilder;

  // Mutations
  mutation(name: string, opts?: MutationOptions): GqlBuilder;

  // Nullability
  nonNull: OmitNonNull<GqlBuilder>;
}

// ArgsBuilder for field arguments
interface ArgsBuilder {
  string(name: string): GraphQLInputType;
  int(name: string): GraphQLInputType;
  float(name: string): GraphQLInputType;
  boolean(name: string): GraphQLInputType;
  id(name: string): GraphQLInputType;

  nonNull: OmitNonNull<ArgsBuilder>;
}
```

### Resolution Logic

Default field resolver chain:

1. Use custom resolver if provided in opts.resolve
2. Try root.props[name] if present
3. Try root[name] as getter or method

For mutations with no custom resolver:

- Call root[name](args, ctx, info) method

### Edge Relationship Implementation

For the BfPerson to BfOrganization relationship:

1. Define edge in BfPerson nodeType with memberOf relationship to BfOrganization
2. Expose the relationship in GraphQL schema using the object method
3. Support bidirectional navigation (person ‚Üí organization, organization ‚Üí
   members)
4. Initially focus on a simple 1:n relationship pattern
5. Provide resolver implementation that uses the underlying bfDb edge data

### Nexus Integration

The builder produces a spec object that is converted to Nexus types at build
time:

```typescript
interface GqlSpec {
  fields: Record<string, FieldSpec>;
  mutations: Record<string, MutationSpec>;
}

// Converted to Nexus ObjectType definitions using gqlSpecToNexus.ts
```

## Success Metrics

- All nodes successfully migrated to new builder pattern
- No changes to client-facing GraphQL schema
- All tests passing, including integration tests
- Improved type safety and IDE support
- Easier addition of new GraphQL types

## Future Work (v0.2+)

- Implement Relay-style connections with pagination
- Add more field types and custom scalars
- Enhance validation and error messages
- Optimize schema generation performance
