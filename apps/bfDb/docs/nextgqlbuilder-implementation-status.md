# GraphQL Builder Implementation Status

## Current Status (as of May 2025)

The implementation of the new GraphQL builder pattern is in progress. We've made significant progress on the core builder architecture but still need to complete the integration with Nexus. Relay-style connection implementation has been deprioritized for v1.

### Completed ‚úÖ

1. **Core Builder Architecture**
   - `makeGqlBuilder.ts` with fluent builder pattern
   - Basic type definitions (`GqlNodeSpec`, `ArgsSpec`)
   - Field methods (`.string()`, `.int()`, `.boolean()`, etc.)
   - Nullable/non-null helpers

2. **makeGqlSpec Entry Point**
   - Takes a builder function and returns a specification
   - Matches pattern of `makeBfDbSpec`

3. **Basic Tests**
   - Tests for scalar fields, nonNull, and mutation recording

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Added detailed comments to GraphQLObjectBase.defineGqlNode
   - Updated backlog.md with connection tasks (deprioritized)
   - Updated nextgqlbuilder.md to reflect current status

### In Progress üîÑ

1. **GraphQL Type Generation**
   - Created placeholder for gqlSpecToNexus.ts
   - Still need to implement mapping from specs to Nexus types

2. **Builder Type Inference**
   - Working on improving type inference for arguments and return types

### Not Started Yet ‚è±Ô∏è

1. **Relation Validation**
   - Need to validate GraphQL relations against bfNodeSpec.relations

2. **Default Resolver Implementation**
   - Default resolvers with proper fallback chain:
     - First try opts.resolve
     - Then try root.props[name]
     - Finally try root[name] as getter or method

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Need tests for Nexus type generation and field resolution

### Deprioritized for v1 üìÖ

1. **Relay-style Connections**
   - Connection field builder with pagination
   - AddditionalArgs for connections
   - Nexus integration for connections

## Next Steps

1. **Complete gqlSpecToNexus.ts Implementation**
   - Convert field specs to Nexus ObjectType definitions
   - Implement scalar/object type conversion
   - Set up resolver implementation

2. **Add Relation Validation**
   - Validate GraphQL relations against bfNodeSpec.relations
   - Throw at build time if missing or wrong cardinality

3. **Update Tests**
   - Add tests for Nexus type generation
   - Test resolver behavior

4. **Example Node Conversion**
   - Convert a single node to use the new builder pattern
   - Ensure it works end-to-end

After the core scalar, object, and mutation functionality is working correctly, we can later implement Relay-style connections in a future iteration.
