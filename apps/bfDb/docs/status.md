# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** IMPLEMENTING v0.3

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project has completed two major milestones: v0.1 (core
builder implementation) and v0.2 (GraphQLNode class and Node interface
implementation). We're now focusing on v0.3 to improve the barrel file system
for automated interface and type registration, which will streamline development
and reduce manual registration work.

## Completed Work

### v0.1 (Core Builder)

- ✅ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed interface in
  `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ✅ Specification System: Implemented `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields,
  relations, and mutations
- ✅ Field Implementation: Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(),
  etc.) with nonNull support
- ✅ Resolver Logic: Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Mutation Support: Added support for mutations with arguments and return
  types
- ✅ Returns Builder: Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
- ✅ Type Generation: Completed `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus
  types
- ✅ Relation Support: Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type
  references
- ✅ GraphQLObjectBase: Updated with comprehensive documentation for the
  defineGqlNode method
- ✅ Dynamic Root Loading: Improved loadGqlTypes.ts to use Object.values for
  automatic root loading

### v0.2 (Node Interface)

- ✅ Create GraphQLNode class that extends GraphQLObjectBase
- ✅ Define Node GraphQL interface in the schema
- ✅ Implement decorator-based interface detection
- ✅ Modify loadGqlTypes.ts to use barrel files for automatic registration
- ✅ Add resolveType function for interface resolution
- ✅ Add tests to verify implementation
- ✅ Refactor BfNode to extend GraphQLNode
- ✅ Interface Detection: Implemented barrel files for automatic interface
  registration with GraphQLInterface decorator
- ✅ Type Safety: Improved typing in loadGqlTypes.ts using
  AnyGraphqlObjectBaseCtor
- ✅ Interface Testing: Added tests for GraphQLNode and interface implementation

## Current Work (v0.3 - Barrel Files)

We're now focusing on improving the barrel file system for automated type
registration:

1. Enhance the barrel file generation system
2. Improve the automatic interface and type detection
3. Create consistent patterns for registration across different entity types
4. Add validation capabilities in the barrel generation process

## Deferred to v0.4

1. Complete the migration of remaining nodes to the new builder pattern
2. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns (target→source,
   many-to-many)
3. Complete additional tests for the GraphQL builder
4. Remove legacy builders completely
5. Add Relay-style connections with pagination support
6. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations
7. ⏱️ Validation: Validation against bfNodeSpec.relations pending

## Blocking Issues

The incomplete GraphQL Builder is currently blocking:

- Login Integration (Google OAuth) project
- Relationship modeling between users and organizations
