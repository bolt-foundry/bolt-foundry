# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** REFOCUSING

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project has completed the core implementation of the builder
pattern and is now refocusing priorities. We've successfully implemented the
core builder functionality, but are deferring the full migration to v0.3 in
order to prioritize implementing the Node interface in v0.2. This will provide
proper GraphQL interface support, which is needed for the Login Integration
project.

## Current Progress

- ✅ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed interface in
  `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ✅ Specification System: Implemented `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields,
  relations, and mutations
- ✅ Field Implementation: Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(),
  etc.) with nonNull support
- ✅ Resolver Logic: Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Mutation Support: Added support for mutations with arguments and return
  types
- ✅ Returns Builder: Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
- ✅ Type Generation: Completed `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus
  types
- ✅ Relation Support: Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type
  references
- ✅ GraphQLObjectBase: Updated with comprehensive documentation for the
  defineGqlNode method
- ✅ Dynamic Root Loading: Improved loadGqlTypes.ts to use Object.values for
  automatic root loading
- ⏱️ Validation: Validation against bfNodeSpec.relations pending

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Implement Node interface for GraphQLObjectBase types (v0.2):
   - Create common "Node" GraphQL interface definition
   - Update gqlSpecToNexus.ts to register interface implementations
   - Add resolveType function for interface resolution
   - Add tests to verify interface implementation

## Deferred to v0.3

1. Complete the migration of remaining nodes to the new builder pattern
2. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns (target→source,
   many-to-many)
3. Complete additional tests for the GraphQL builder
4. Remove legacy builders completely
5. Add Relay-style connections with pagination support
6. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations

## Blocking Issues

The incomplete GraphQL Builder is currently blocking:

- Login Integration (Google OAuth) project
- Relationship modeling between users and organizations
