# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** REFOCUSING

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project has completed the core implementation of the builder
pattern and is now refocusing priorities. We've successfully implemented the
core builder functionality, but are deferring the full migration to v0.3 in
order to prioritize implementing the GraphQLNode class and Node interface in
v0.2. This will provide proper GraphQL interface support and improve our class
hierarchy, which is needed for the Login Integration project.

## Current Progress

- ✅ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed interface in
  `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ✅ Specification System: Implemented `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields,
  relations, and mutations
- ✅ Field Implementation: Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(),
  etc.) with nonNull support
- ✅ Resolver Logic: Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Mutation Support: Added support for mutations with arguments and return
  types
- ✅ Returns Builder: Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
- ✅ Type Generation: Completed `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus
  types
- ✅ Relation Support: Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type
  references
- ✅ GraphQLObjectBase: Updated with comprehensive documentation for the
  defineGqlNode method
- ✅ Dynamic Root Loading: Improved loadGqlTypes.ts to use Object.values for
  automatic root loading
- ⏱️ Interface Detection: Using inheritance-based detection for GraphQL
  interfaces
- ⏱️ Validation: Validation against bfNodeSpec.relations pending

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Implement GraphQLNode and Node interface (v0.2):
   - Create GraphQLNode class that extends GraphQLObjectBase
   - Define Node GraphQL interface in the schema
   - Implement automatic interface detection in loadGqlTypes.ts based on class
     inheritance
   - Modify gqlSpecToNexus.ts to automatically detect GraphQLNode types through
     inheritance patterns
   - Refactor BfNode to extend GraphQLNode
   - Add resolveType function for interface resolution
   - Add tests to verify implementation

## Deferred to v0.3

1. Complete the migration of remaining nodes to the new builder pattern
2. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns (target→source,
   many-to-many)
3. Complete additional tests for the GraphQL builder
4. Remove legacy builders completely
5. Add Relay-style connections with pagination support
6. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations

## Blocking Issues

The incomplete GraphQL Builder is currently blocking:

- Login Integration (Google OAuth) project
- Relationship modeling between users and organizations
