# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** IMPLEMENTING v0.3

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project has completed two major milestones: v0.1 (core
builder implementation) and v0.2 (GraphQLNode class and Node interface
implementation). We're now focusing on v0.3 to ensure GraphQL interfaces are
properly registered and loaded in the schema.

## Completed Work

### v0.1 (Core Builder)

- ✅ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed interface in
  `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ✅ Specification System: Implemented `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields,
  relations, and mutations
- ✅ Field Implementation: Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(),
  etc.) with nonNull support
- ✅ Resolver Logic: Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Mutation Support: Added support for mutations with arguments and return
  types
- ✅ Returns Builder: Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
- ✅ Type Generation: Completed `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus
  types
- ✅ Relation Support: Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type
  references
- ✅ GraphQLObjectBase: Updated with comprehensive documentation for the
  defineGqlNode method
- ✅ Dynamic Root Loading: Improved loadGqlTypes.ts to use Object.values for
  automatic root loading

### v0.2 (Node Interface)

- ✅ Create GraphQLNode class that extends GraphQLObjectBase
- ✅ Define Node GraphQL interface in the schema
- ✅ Implement decorator-based interface detection
- ✅ Modify loadGqlTypes.ts to use barrel files for automatic registration
- ✅ Add resolveType function for interface resolution
- ✅ Add tests to verify implementation
- ✅ Refactor BfNode to extend GraphQLNode
- ✅ Interface Detection: Implemented barrel files for automatic interface
  registration with GraphQLInterface decorator
- ✅ Type Safety: Improved typing in loadGqlTypes.ts using
  AnyGraphqlObjectBaseCtor
- ✅ Interface Testing: Added tests for GraphQLNode and interface implementation

## Current Work (v0.3 - Interface Loading)

We're now focusing on improving the GraphQL interface registration:

1. Ensure genBarrel.ts includes GraphQL interfaces 
2. Verify the interfacesList.ts barrel file contains all interfaces
3. Ensure loadGqlTypes.ts correctly uses the interfaces from the barrel file

## Deferred to v0.4

1. Implement barrel files for other GraphQL type categories
2. Add validation during barrel generation
3. Create a more comprehensive barrel utility
4. Complete the migration of remaining nodes to the new builder pattern
5. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns
6. Add Relay-style connections with pagination support
7. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations

## Blocking Issues

The incomplete GraphQL Builder is currently blocking:

- Login Integration (Google OAuth) project
- Relationship modeling between users and organizations
