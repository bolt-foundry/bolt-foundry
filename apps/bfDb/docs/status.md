# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project is actively being implemented, with focus on completing the core functionality needed to enable the Login Integration project. This new builder pattern will replace the legacy three-helper GraphQL DSL with a single-argument fluent builder pattern.

## Current Progress

- ‚úÖ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed initial interface in `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ‚úÖ Specification System: Created `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields, relations, and mutations
- ‚úÖ Stub Implementation: Basic structure of `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus types
- üîÑ Field Implementation: Working on scalar field methods (.string(), .int(), etc.)
- üîÑ Resolver Logic: Implementing proper field resolver chain
- ‚è±Ô∏è Relation Support: Edge relationships still need implementation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Validation: Validation against bfNodeSpec.relations pending

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Complete the implementation of `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` with full Nexus type generation
2. Implement field resolver logic with proper fallback chain
3. Finish the core implementation of `makeGqlBuilder.ts` with all field types
4. Add support for edge relationships between BfPerson and BfOrganization
5. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations

## Blocking Issues

The incomplete GraphQL Builder is currently blocking:
- Login Integration (Google OAuth) project
- Relationship modeling between users and organizations

## Estimated Completion

Target completion: ~1 week (for core functionality needed by Login Integration)
