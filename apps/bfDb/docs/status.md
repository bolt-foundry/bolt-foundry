# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** IN PROGRESS

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project is actively being implemented, with focus on
completing the core functionality needed to enable the Login Integration
project. This new builder pattern will replace the legacy three-helper GraphQL
DSL with a single-argument fluent builder pattern.

## Current Progress

- ✅ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed interface in
  `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ✅ Specification System: Implemented `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields,
  relations, and mutations
- ✅ Field Implementation: Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(),
  etc.) with nonNull support
- ✅ Resolver Logic: Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Mutation Support: Added support for mutations with arguments and return
  types
- ✅ Returns Builder: Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
- ✅ Type Generation: Completed `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus
  types
- ✅ Relation Support: Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type
  references
- ✅ GraphQLObjectBase: Updated with comprehensive documentation for the
  defineGqlNode method
- ✅ Dynamic Root Loading: Improved loadGqlTypes.ts to use Object.values for
  automatic root loading
- ⏱️ Validation: Validation against bfNodeSpec.relations pending

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Test and validate with a complete example node type
2. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns (target→source,
   many-to-many)
3. Complete remaining tests for the GraphQL builder

## Blocking Issues

The incomplete GraphQL Builder is currently blocking:

- Login Integration (Google OAuth) project
- Relationship modeling between users and organizations
