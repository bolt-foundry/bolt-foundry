# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** PHASE 1 COMPLETE, PROCEEDING TO PHASE 2

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder v0.1 has completed its core implementation goals. We've 
successfully implemented the fluent builder pattern, edge relationship support, 
and mutation returns builder. We're now proceeding to v0.2, which will focus 
on implementing the GraphQLNode class and Node interface. This will provide 
proper GraphQL interface support and improve our class hierarchy, which is 
needed for the Login Integration project.

## Current Progress (v0.1)

- ✅ Core Builder Implementation:
  - Created `makeGqlBuilder.ts` with fluent interface
  - Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(), etc.)
  - Added nullability helpers
  - Created argument builder
  
- ✅ Builder Infrastructure:
  - Created `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields, relations, and mutations
  - Implemented `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus types
  - Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
  - Added support for mutations with arguments and return types
  - Added `schemaConfig.ts` for centralized schema configuration
  
- ✅ Edge Relationships:
  - Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type references
  - Added support for BfPerson and BfOrganization relationship
  - Implemented implicit relationships for object fields without custom resolvers
  - Used field names as edge roles for intuitive API
  
- ✅ Mutation Returns Builder:
  - Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
  - Added support for scalar field methods in return types
  - Implemented nonNull pattern for required fields
  - Added automatic payload type generation and registration
  - Added type inference for resolver functions
  
- ✅ Schema Integration:
  - Updated GraphQLObjectBase.defineGqlNode with comprehensive documentation
  - Improved loadGqlTypes.ts for dynamic root object loading
  - Implemented genGqlTypes.bff.ts for automated type generation
  
- ✅ Testing:
  - Added unit tests for builder functionality
  - Added tests for Nexus type generation
  - Added basic integration tests for builder usage
  - Added argument builder tests
  
- ⏱️ Connection Support:
  - Implemented stub for connection method in builder interface
  - Full implementation deferred to v0.3
  
- ⏱️ Validation:
  - Validation against bfNodeSpec.relations pending
  - Schema-level validation planned for v0.3

## Next Steps (v0.2)

1. Implement GraphQLNode and Node interface:
   - Create GraphQLNode class that extends GraphQLObjectBase
   - Define Node GraphQL interface in the schema
   - Update loadGqlTypes.ts to automatically register the Node interface
   - Modify gqlSpecToNexus.ts to automatically detect GraphQLNode types
   - Refactor BfNode to extend GraphQLNode
   - Add resolveType function for interface resolution
   - Add tests to verify implementation

2. Support the Login Integration project:
   - Ensure proper relationship modeling between users and organizations
   - Test GraphQL queries for user authentication
   - Implement necessary mutation resolvers for login functionality

## Deferred to v0.3

1. Complete migration of remaining nodes to the new builder pattern
2. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns (target→source, many-to-many)
3. Add comprehensive testing coverage for all components
4. Remove legacy builders completely
5. Implement Relay-style connections with pagination support
6. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations
7. Add more field types and custom scalars
8. Enhance validation and error messages
9. Optimize schema generation performance

## Integration Projects

The GraphQL Builder is currently supporting the following projects:

- Login Integration (Google OAuth)
- User-Organization relationship modeling
- Waitlist functionality
