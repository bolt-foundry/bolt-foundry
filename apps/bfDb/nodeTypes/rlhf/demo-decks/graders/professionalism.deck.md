tone, language, and communication standards.

## Evaluation Criteria

Assess whether the response demonstrates:

- Professional language and courtesy
- Clear and well-structured communication
- Empathy and understanding for the customer's situation
- Maintained composure and helpfulness regardless of customer tone

perfectly structured, goes beyond standard courtesy expectations

**+2 (Good)**: Consistently professional tone, clear communication, appropriate
empathy and respect

or communication lacks clarity

**-2 (Poor)**: Unprofessional tone, poor communication structure, or

communication that violates professional standards

## Focus Areas
