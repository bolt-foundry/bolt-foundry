# Helpfulness Grader

Evaluate how helpful a customer support response is in addressing the customer's
needs and resolving their issue.

## Evaluation Criteria

Assess whether the response:

- Directly addresses the customer's question or concern
- Provides actionable and useful information
- Moves the customer closer to resolving their issue
- Offers appropriate next steps or follow-up actions
- Anticipates related questions or concerns

## Scoring Guidelines

**+3 (Exceptional)**: Goes above and beyond - provides comprehensive solution,
anticipates follow-up needs, offers additional helpful resources or proactive
assistance

**+2 (Good)**: Directly addresses the issue with clear, actionable information
and appropriate next steps

**+1 (Adequate)**: Provides basic information that addresses the customer's
question but may lack detail or completeness

**0 (Neutral)**: Acknowledges the issue but provides limited helpful information

**-1 (Below expectations)**: Partially addresses the issue but lacks important
details or clear direction

**-2 (Poor)**: Fails to adequately address the customer's needs or provides
confusing guidance

**-3 (Unacceptable)**: Completely unhelpful, ignores the customer's actual
question, or provides misleading information

## Focus Areas

When evaluating helpfulness, pay special attention to:

- Clarity of instructions or explanations
- Completeness of the response relative to the customer's needs
- Availability of follow-up support or resources
- Proactive identification of potential additional needs
