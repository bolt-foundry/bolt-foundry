# v0.2 Bolt Foundry Strategy

## Overview

Our strategy right now is to go deep with two early partners who have urgent LLM
problems, and use that work to prove out our approach to model evals and
observability.

With Sunset, we’re basically acting as an extension of their engineering team,
helping them move off Cobbery and get to a place where they can start running
human-in-the-loop AI calls to the IRS. If we can’t solve this, their company
could fail.

With Stanify, the pain is more about improving quality. We’re building out an
evaluation and observability pipeline. Success will be measured by the number of
prompt regenerations and edits by their end users. The infra we’re building for
Stanify will also apply to Sunset.

Justin and Josh are focused on Sunset, Randall’s focused on Stanify, and Dan is
bridging both efforts.

**Our goal is to get strong case studies from both clients in the next 4 weeks
so we can raise a seed round by the end of May.**
