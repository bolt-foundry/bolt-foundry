# Collector Project Status

**Current Status:** ON HOLD ⏱️

## Status Details

The Collector project is on hold while we focus on updating the bolt-foundry
library in the packages directory. All projects are temporarily paused during
this library update.

## Reason for Hold

1. Need to focus on bolt-foundry library updates
2. Potential architectural changes to the analytics approach
3. Re-evaluation of data collection requirements

## Current Progress

Before the hold, the project had:

- Completed initial planning and architecture design
- Established basic requirements for API interception
- Defined integration points with existing systems

## Resumption Criteria

The project will be resumed after:

1. Completion of bolt-foundry library updates
2. Clear definition of analytics requirements
3. Determination of the appropriate technical approach

## Related Components

While the Collector project is on hold, any dependencies on this system should
be handled as follows:

- Frontend analytics: Continue using direct PostHog integration
- LLM metrics: Use existing bolt-foundry package capabilities
- API tracking: Implement temporary solutions within application code
