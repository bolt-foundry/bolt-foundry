# E2E Testing Backlog

This document tracks the features and enhancements for E2E testing that have
been completed versus those that remain to be implemented.

## Completed Features

### Version 0.1: Foundation

- ✅ Basic E2E testing infrastructure using Puppeteer
- ✅ Test utility functions (setup, teardown, navigation)
- ✅ Screenshot capture capabilities
- ✅ Integration with BFF CLI for test execution
- ✅ Browser console logging integration
- ✅ Basic test runner configuration

## Backlog Items

### Version 0.2: Integration

**Priority**: Medium | **Complexity**: Moderate

- Visual regression testing capabilities for key components
- Additional test coverage for authentication flows
- Expanded CI/CD pipeline integration
- Performance measurement baselines
- Environment-specific test configuration

### Version 0.3: Enhancement

**Priority**: Low | **Complexity**: Complex

- Automated test reporting and dashboards
- Performance testing for critical user journeys
- Cross-browser testing capabilities
- Custom test reporters
- Advanced test data management

## Implementation Notes

### Visual Regression Testing

```typescript
// Proposed implementation for visual regression testing
export async function compareScreenshots(
  baselinePath: string,
  newScreenshot: string,
  threshold = 0.1,
): Promise<{ matching: boolean; diffPercentage: number }> {
  // Implementation details for pixel-by-pixel comparison
}
```

### Performance Testing

```typescript
// Proposed implementation for performance testing
export async function measurePerformance(
  page: Page,
  action: () => Promise<void>,
): Promise<PerformanceMetrics> {
  // Implementation details for capturing performance metrics
}
```

## Next Steps

When ready to resume E2E testing development:

1. Begin with Visual Regression Testing from Version 0.2
2. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline more deeply
3. Implement advanced reporting capabilities
