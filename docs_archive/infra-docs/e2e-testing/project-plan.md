# E2E Testing Project Plan

## Project Purpose

To implement a comprehensive end-to-end testing strategy for Bolt Foundry that
ensures reliable user experiences across critical application workflows and
integrations, following the team's "Worse is Better" philosophy and test-driven
development principles.

## Project Versions Overview

1. **Version 0.1: Foundation**
   - Set up basic e2e testing infrastructure using Deno-compatible tools
   - Create initial tests for critical user flows
   - Establish patterns for writing and maintaining e2e tests

2. **Version 0.2: Integration**
   - Integrate e2e tests with CI/CD pipeline
   - Expand test coverage to include authentication flows
   - Add visual regression testing capabilities

3. **Version 0.3: Enhancement**
   - Create automated test reporting and dashboards
   - Implement performance testing for critical user journeys
   - Add cross-browser testing capabilities

## User Personas

- **Developers**: Need confidence that changes don't break existing
  functionality
- **QA Engineers**: Need tools to verify application behavior across integrated
  components
- **Product Managers**: Need visibility into application reliability and
  performance

## Success Metrics

- 90% test coverage for critical user flows
- e2e test suite runs in under 10 minutes
- All regressions caught before deployment
- Automated visual regression tests for key UI components

## Version 0.1: Foundation Implementation Plan

### Technical Goals

- Create reliable e2e testing infrastructure compatible with Deno
- Establish patterns for testing full application workflows
- Implement basic smoke tests for critical user paths

### Components and Implementation

1. **Testing Framework**
   - Select and implement a Deno-compatible e2e testing solution
   - Create helper utilities for common testing operations
   - Set up browser automation capabilities

2. **Test Structure**
   - Define organization for test files and utilities
   - Establish patterns for page objects and test helpers
   - Create documentation for writing and maintaining tests

3. **Initial Test Coverage**
   - Authentication flows (login, registration)
   - Basic navigation and routing
   - Core feature functionality

### Integration Points

- BFF CLI integration for running tests locally and in CI
- Test reporting compatible with existing tooling
- Integration with existing UI components for testing

### Testing Strategy

- Define critical user flows to test first
- Create baseline assertions for each flow
- Implement visual testing for UI components
- Set up monitoring for test reliability and performance

## Test Plan

Our tests define behavior, not implementation:

1. **Authentication Flow Test**:
   - Red: Write tests for user login and registration flows
   - Green: Implement e2e tests with realistic user interactions
   - Refactor: Improve test reliability and reduce flakiness

2. **Navigation Test**:
   - Red: Write tests for application navigation and routing
   - Green: Implement tests that verify correct page rendering
   - Refactor: Extract common patterns into reusable utilities

3. **Core Feature Tests**:
   - Red: Write tests for mission-critical features
   - Green: Implement realistic user scenario tests
   - Refactor: Optimize for speed and reliability

4. **Visual Regression Tests**:
   - Red: Write tests for visual consistency of key components
   - Green: Implement basic screenshot comparison
   - Refactor: Improve accuracy and reduce false positives

Remember: Failure counts as done. This plan prioritizes building a simple but
effective solution focused on real user needs, testing at each step, and getting
working code into users' hands quickly rather than perfect code in development.
