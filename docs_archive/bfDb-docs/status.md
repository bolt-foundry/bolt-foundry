# GraphQL Builder Status

**Current Status:** ON HOLD ⏱️

## Status Details

The GraphQL Builder project is on hold while we focus on updating the
bolt-foundry library in the packages directory. All projects are temporarily
paused during this library update.

## Previously Completed Work

### v0.1 (Core Builder)

- ✅ Core Builder Interface Definition: Completed interface in
  `makeGqlBuilder.ts`
- ✅ Specification System: Implemented `makeGqlSpec.ts` to collect fields,
  relations, and mutations
- ✅ Field Implementation: Implemented scalar field methods (.string(), .int(),
  etc.) with nonNull support
- ✅ Resolver Logic: Implemented field resolver chain with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Mutation Support: Added support for mutations with arguments and return
  types
- ✅ Returns Builder: Implemented mutation returns builder with type inference
- ✅ Type Generation: Completed `gqlSpecToNexus.ts` to convert specs to Nexus
  types
- ✅ Relation Support: Implemented edge relationships with thunk-style type
  references
- ✅ GraphQLObjectBase: Updated with comprehensive documentation for the
  defineGqlNode method
- ✅ Dynamic Root Loading: Improved loadGqlTypes.ts to use Object.values for
  automatic root loading

### v0.2 (Node Interface)

- ✅ Create GraphQLNode class that extends GraphQLObjectBase
- ✅ Define Node GraphQL interface in the schema
- ✅ Implement decorator-based interface detection
- ✅ Modify loadGqlTypes.ts to use barrel files for automatic registration
- ✅ Add resolveType function for interface resolution
- ✅ Add tests to verify implementation
- ✅ Refactor BfNode to extend GraphQLNode
- ✅ Interface Detection: Implemented barrel files for automatic interface
  registration with GraphQLInterface decorator
- ✅ Type Safety: Improved typing in loadGqlTypes.ts using
  AnyGraphqlObjectBaseCtor
- ✅ Interface Testing: Added tests for GraphQLNode and interface implementation

### v0.3 (Interface Detection & Loading)

- ✅ Create GraphQLInterface decorator for marking interface classes
- ✅ Update genBarrel.ts to scan for @GraphQLInterface decorator in files
- ✅ Verify the interfacesList.ts barrel file correctly contains decorated
  interfaces
- ✅ Ensure loadInterfaces.ts properly registers decorated interfaces in the
  schema
- ✅ Update tests to verify decorator-based interface detection works correctly
- ✅ Implement more robust detection of interface implementations in GraphQL
  objects

## Pending Work (v0.4 - On Hold)

1. Implement barrel files for other GraphQL type categories
2. Add validation during barrel generation
3. Create a more comprehensive barrel utility
4. Complete the migration of remaining nodes to the new builder pattern
5. Add support for additional edge relationship patterns
6. Add Relay-style connections with pagination support
7. Implement validation against bfNodeSpec.relations
