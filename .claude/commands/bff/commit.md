description: Create a commit using BFF with automatic formatting, linting, and PR submission
---

Please help me create a commit for the current uncommitted changes.

First, run bff ai diff to see the uncommitted changes.

Then, see if the changes can be logically grouped. We should be grouping
according to features / breakage, not just by "items that fit together." For
instance, if there are documentation updates and functionality updates, if the
documentation updates are for the functions, they should be committed together.
If committing part of something would cause breakage, it should be committed as
a whole unit to prevent the app from failing.

Then, commit each logical grouping using "bff commit -m 'use the style from the
example commit message below' filepath-1.md filepath-2.md

The linter runs as part of the bff commit command, so if the files are updated,
don't worry, that's expected. There might be test failures. We should try to fix
those test failures as part of the commit. After fixing them, run
`bff ai precommit` to ensure they're fixed before trying a commit again.

Finally, submit all the pull requests using "sl pr submit".

## Example Commit Message

```
Remove connection implementation from GraphQL builder

Simplify the initial implementation by removing Relay Connection support.
Focus on core scalar fields, object fields, and mutations for v1.

Changes:
- Remove connection method, interface, and imports from makeGqlBuilder.ts
- Remove connection tests from makeGqlBuilder.test.ts
- Create placeholder for gqlSpecToNexus.ts with TODOs

Test plan:
1. Run tests: `bff test apps/bfDb/builders/graphql/__tests__/makeGqlBuilder.test.ts`
2. Verify builder supports scalar fields, objects, and mutations
