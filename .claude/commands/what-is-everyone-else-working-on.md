# What Is Everyone Else Working On

Let me help you check what your team members are working on. I'll look for
recent activity and ongoing work.

What would you like to know specifically? For example:

- Recent commits and changes?
- Active pull requests or branches?
- Current project status?
- Specific team member's work?
