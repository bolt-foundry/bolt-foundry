# NPM Publishing Implementation Plan

## Technical Architecture Overview

The NPM publishing system will transform our Deno codebase into a format compatible with Node.js and npm, providing a seamless experience for npm users while maintaining our Deno-first development approach.

## Reasoning and Approach

We're using dnt (Deno to Node Transform) as our primary tool because:
1. It's specifically designed for Deno â†’ Node.js transformations
2. It handles TypeScript definitions automatically
3. It provides built-in testing capabilities
4. It maintains the integrity of our source code

## System Components and Their Relationships

1. **Build Pipeline**: Transforms Deno code to Node.js compatible code
2. **Type Generation**: Creates and validates TypeScript definitions
3. **Testing Framework**: Verifies compatibility in Node.js environment
4. **Publication Workflow**: Automates versioning and npm publishing

## Version Breakdown with Technical Goals

### Version 0.1: Foundation
- Configure dnt for our codebase structure
- Create basic npm package structure
- Set up initial transformation pipeline
- Implement compatibility layer for Deno-specific APIs

### Version 0.2: Core Functionality
- Transform all core modules and their dependencies
- Generate comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- Implement test suite for Node.js compatibility
- Create CI/CD workflow for automated builds

### Version 0.3: Enhancement
- Optimize bundle size and performance
- Implement semantic versioning strategy
- Add comprehensive documentation for npm users
- Create examples for common npm use cases

## Data Architecture

- **Source of Truth**: Deno codebase remains the primary development target
- **Generated Artifacts**: Node.js compatible code, type definitions, and package metadata
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with synchronized Deno and npm versions

## Security Considerations

- Avoid exposing internal APIs not meant for public consumption
- Ensure proper handling of API keys and secrets in examples
- Implement proper dependency security scanning
- Maintain lock files for reproducible builds

## Technical Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Deno-specific APIs | High | Create compatibility shims for Node.js |
| Type definition incompatibilities | Medium | Thorough testing of TypeScript definitions |
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Careful management of dependency versions |
| Breaking changes in dnt | Low | Pin dnt version and upgrade carefully |
