# NPM Publishing Project Plan

## Project Purpose

To build and distribute a fully typesafe version of our library to npm,
leveraging dnt to transform our Deno code into Node-compatible packages.

## User Personas

- **Package Consumers**: Developers who will use our library in Node.js/npm
  environments
- **Package Maintainers**: Developers responsible for updating and releasing new
  versions
- **Project Contributors**: Developers who contribute code but don't handle
  releases

## Success Metrics

- Successfully published package on npm registry
- Full TypeScript type definitions included
- 100% feature parity with Deno version
- Automated build and publish workflow
- Comprehensive documentation for npm users

## Project Versions Overview

### Version 0.1: Foundation

- Set up build pipeline using dnt
- Configure package.json generation
- Implement basic test suite for Node compatibility

### Version 0.2: Core Functionality

- Complete transformation of all core modules
- Add comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- Create CI/CD automation for package builds

### Version 0.3: Enhancement

- Implement versioning strategy
- Add package documentation for npm consumers
- Optimize bundle size and performance

## User Journeys

### Package Consumer Journey

1. Discovers our package on npm
2. Installs package with npm/yarn/pnpm
3. Imports types and functions in their TypeScript project
4. Gets full IDE autocompletion support
5. Successfully integrates our library into their application

### Package Maintainer Journey

1. Makes changes to the Deno codebase
2. Runs build process to generate npm package
3. Verifies compatibility through automated tests
4. Publishes a new version to npm
5. Updates documentation to reflect changes

## Risk Assessment

- **Compatibility Risks**: Deno-specific APIs may not have Node equivalents
- **Type Definition Risks**: TypeScript types may not translate perfectly
- **Maintenance Risks**: Keeping npm and Deno versions in sync
- **Dependency Risks**: Managing dependencies across both ecosystems
