# Google Cloud Secrets Manager Project Plan

## Project Purpose

We're creating a system to securely store and manage sensitive configuration
data (like API keys and passwords) in Google Cloud Platform using Terraform.
This provides Bolt Foundry with an automated, version-controlled approach to
secrets management that works across all environments.

## Project Versions Overview

### Version 0.1: Foundation

- Set up the basic infrastructure in `infra/gcp`
- Create a working Terraform configuration for GCP
- Implement initial Secrets Manager for storing basic secrets
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for deploying infrastructure changes

### Testing Strategy

- **Infrastructure Testing**: Validate Terraform configurations before
  deployment
- **Integration Testing**: Verify secret access from test applications
- **Security Testing**: Validate access controls and permissions
- **Performance Testing**: Measure secret access latency for application
  integration

### Version Dependencies

- GCP project with appropriate IAM permissions
- Existing CI/CD infrastructure for deployments
- Terraform installed in CI/CD environments

### Version Exit Criteria

- Terraform configurations successfully deploying to GCP
- Secrets Manager able to store and retrieve secrets
- CI/CD pipeline validating and applying changes
- Basic documentation available for developers

## Technical Considerations

### Directory Structure

The project will be placed in `infra/gcp` following the established pattern for
infrastructure code in the Bolt Foundry repository:

```
infra/gcp/
├── README.md
├── main.tf
├── variables.tf
├── outputs.tf
├── versions.tf
├── backend.tf
├── modules/
│   └── secrets/
└── environments/
    ├── dev/
    ├── staging/
    └── prod/
```

### Terraform State Management

To ensure safe and collaborative infrastructure management:

- Terraform state will be stored in a GCS bucket
- State locking will be implemented to prevent concurrent modifications
- Sensitive data in state will be encrypted

### Security Approach

Following the "Worse is Better" philosophy, we'll focus on:

- Simple, working security controls rather than perfect abstract solutions
- Practical access patterns that developers can easily understand
- Clear separation of access between environments
- Iterative improvements based on real usage

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk                     | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GCP permission issues    | High   | Medium     | Create dedicated service accounts with minimal permissions     |
| Terraform state exposure | High   | Low        | Use encrypted state storage and restrict access to state files |

## Future Considerations (for v0.2+)

- Automated secret rotation workflows
- Integration with application runtime environments
- Secret access monitoring and anomaly detection
- Cross-project secret sharing
- BFF CLI extensions for secrets management

## Success Criteria for v0.1

Version 0.1 will be considered successful when:

1. The infrastructure as code is deployed in GCP
2. Secrets can be securely stored and retrieved
3. CI/CD pipeline is correctly applying infrastructure changes
4. Basic access controls are implemented
5. Documentation for developers is available

This project plan will evolve with each version, with feedback and learning from
each phase incorporated into future versions.
