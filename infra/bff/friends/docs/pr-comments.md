=== Summary ===
Total threads: 12
Unresolved: 12
Resolved: 0
```

## pr-resolve

Resolves a specific review thread on a GitHub pull request.

### Usage

```bash
bff pr-resolve PR_NUMBER THREAD_ID
```

### Example

```bash
bff pr-resolve 763 PRRT_kwDONzx_xs5QFyJ_
```

### Requirements

- Requires write permissions to the repository
- Specifically needs Repository Permissions > Contents set to Read and Write
  access
- Must be authenticated with GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`)

### How it works

1. Uses GitHub's GraphQL API to execute the `resolveReviewThread` mutation
2. Requires the review thread ID (not just the comment ID)
3. Thread IDs can be found using the `bff pr-threads` command

### Common errors

- "Failed to resolve review thread" - Check authentication and permissions
- "Invalid thread ID" - Use `bff pr-threads` to get valid thread IDs

## Workflow example

1. View comments on a PR:
   ```bash
   bff pr-comments 763
   ```

2. List review threads to see what needs resolution:
   ```bash
   bff pr-threads 763
   ```

3. Resolve specific threads:
   ```bash
   bff pr-resolve 763 PRRT_kwDONzx_xs5QFyJ_
   ```

4. Verify resolution:
   ```bash
   bff pr-threads 763
   ```

## Technical details

- These commands use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for API access
- pr-comments uses REST API endpoints
- pr-threads and pr-resolve use GraphQL API
- All commands automatically detect the repository from Sapling configuration
