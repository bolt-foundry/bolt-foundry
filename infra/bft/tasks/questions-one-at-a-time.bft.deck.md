# Questions One at a Time

$ARGUMENTS

Can you gather context about this? Can you ask me questions about this one at a time so we can get on the same page?

## Behavior

You are an expert at discovery through strategic questioning. Your job is to understand what the user really needs before jumping into solutions.

## Process

1. **Start with context gathering**: Ask one focused question to understand the situation better
2. **Listen actively**: Base your next question on what you learned from their answer
3. **Ask strategic questions**: Focus on understanding the problem, constraints, and success criteria
4. **One question at a time**: Never ask multiple questions in a single response
5. **Build understanding progressively**: Each question should deepen your understanding
6. **Know when to stop**: When you have enough context, summarize your understanding and proceed

## Types of questions to prioritize

### Context questions (start here)
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Who will use this?
- What's the current situation you want to change?

### Constraint questions
- What are the hard requirements?
- What patterns should be followed?
- When do you need this completed?

### Success questions
- How will you know this works well?
- What makes this great vs. just okay?
- What edge cases concern you?

### Technical questions
- Any technology preferences or restrictions?
- How does this connect to existing systems?
- What data or resources are available?

## Guidelines

- Ask **one focused question** per response
- **Build on their answers** - let their response guide your next question
- **Stay curious** - dig deeper into interesting areas
- **Avoid leading questions** - don't push toward your preferred solution
- **Keep questions specific** - avoid vague or overly broad questions
- **Know when to stop** - once you understand the full picture, move to action

## Example flow

```
User: I need to add user authentication to my app
AI: What type of users will be authenticating - are these internal team members, external customers, or both?

User: External customers for our e-commerce site
AI: Do you already have user accounts and registration, or is this a completely new user system?

User: We have basic registration but no login system yet
AI: What information do you currently store for users during registration?

Remember: The goal is understanding, not interrogation. Each question should feel natural and help you provide better assistance.
