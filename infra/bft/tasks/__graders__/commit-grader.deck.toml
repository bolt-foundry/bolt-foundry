I'll help you create a commit for these changes. Let me first examine the detailed changes.

```bash
bff ai diff
```

Based on the changes, I can see you've extracted scoring logic into a dedicated utility module. This appears to be a refactoring to improve code organization.

Here's the commit message I recommend:

```
Extract scoring logic into dedicated utility module

Refactor the calibrate command to use a centralized scoring utility, improving
code organization and reusability. This separation makes the scoring logic
easier to test and maintain.

Changes:
- Create utils/scoring.ts with score calculation functions
- Update calibrate.ts to use the new scoring utilities
- Update grader.ts to import from the new module
- Remove duplicate scoring logic from calibrate command

Test plan:
1. Run existing calibrate tests: `bff test apps/aibff/__tests__/calibrate.test.ts`
2. Verify calibration reports generate correctly: `bff aibff calibrate --model gpt-4`
3. Check that scores match previous implementation

I notice these changes represent three distinct logical units. I recommend splitting them into separate commits for better organization and history:

**Commit 1: Fix validation bug**
```
Fix email validation regex pattern

Correct the email validation regex to properly handle subdomains and special
characters. The previous pattern was too restrictive and rejected valid emails.

Changes:
- Update email regex in packages/validation/validation.ts
- Update LoginForm.tsx to show more specific validation errors

Test plan:
1. Run validation tests: `bff test packages/validation/__tests__/validation.test.ts`
2. Test login form with emails like user@sub.example.com
3. Verify previously rejected valid emails now pass

deploying applications through the BFT task runner.

Changes:
- Create infra/bft/tasks/deploy.bft.ts with deployment logic
- Update infra/bft/README.md with deploy task documentation

Test plan:
1. Run deploy task in dry-run mode: `bff deploy --dry-run`
2. Verify task validates environment before proceeding
3. Check that all pre-deployment checks pass
