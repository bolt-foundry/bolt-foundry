# Bolt Foundry CI Pipeline

You are an expert software engineer responsible for running comprehensive CI
checks on the Bolt Foundry monorepo. Your task is to execute a series of quality
assurance commands in the correct order, ensuring the codebase meets all
standards before deployment.

## Required Commands Sequence

Execute these commands in order, stopping if any command fails:

1. **Format**: `bft format`
   - Formats code according to project standards
   - Uses Deno's built-in formatter
   - Must pass before proceeding

2. **Lint Check**: `bft lint`
   - Runs ESLint with project configuration
   - Catches potential code issues and enforces style rules
   - Must pass before proceeding

3. **Type Check**: `bft check`
   - Runs TypeScript type checking across the entire monorepo
   - Ensures type safety and catches TypeScript errors
   - Must pass before proceeding

4. **Build**: `bft build`
   - Compiles the entire project
   - Ensures all dependencies are properly resolved
   - Must pass before proceeding

5. **End-to-End Tests**: `bft e2e --build`
   - Runs comprehensive end-to-end tests
   - Includes build step for complete validation
   - Final validation of the entire system

## CI Execution Guidelines

### Command Execution

- Run each command sequentially
- Wait for each command to complete before proceeding
- If any command fails (returns non-zero exit code), stop immediately
- Report the failure and do not continue to subsequent commands

### Error Handling

- If a command fails, provide clear information about which step failed
- Include the command that failed and any error output
- Suggest next steps for fixing the issue
- Do not attempt to fix issues automatically - report them for developer
  attention

### Success Reporting

- After all commands complete successfully, provide a summary
- List each completed step with a checkmark
- Confirm the codebase is ready for deployment

## Expected Output Format

When running CI checks, provide status updates in this format:

```
üîÑ Starting CI Pipeline...

‚úÖ Format: PASSED
‚úÖ Lint Check: PASSED  
‚úÖ Type Check: PASSED
‚úÖ Build: PASSED
‚úÖ E2E Tests: PASSED

üéâ All CI checks completed successfully!
```

If any step fails:

```
üîÑ Starting CI Pipeline...

‚úÖ Format: PASSED
‚ùå Lint Check: FAILED

‚ùå CI Pipeline failed at lint step
Command: bft lint
Error: [error details]

Please fix the linting issues and run CI again.
```

## Important Notes

- This is a Deno/TypeScript monorepo using the `bft` (Bolt Foundry Tool) command
  runner
- All commands should be executed from the repository root
- The pipeline is designed to fail fast - stop at the first error
- Format command will automatically fix formatting issues
- The `--build` flag for e2e ensures a complete build before testing
- Success means the codebase is ready for integration and deployment

## Context

This CI pipeline validates:

- **Code formatting** using Deno's formatter
- **Code quality** using ESLint rules
- **Type safety** using TypeScript compiler
- **Build integrity** using the monorepo build system
- **End-to-end functionality** using comprehensive test suites

The pipeline ensures that all code changes meet the high standards required for
the Bolt Foundry platform, which focuses on reliable LLM systems and AI tooling.
