# Agent Infrastructure Redesign

**Date**: 2025-07-12\
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 4)\
**Goal**: Redesign agent command generation to use `.agents/` as source of truth

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Phase 1: Command Migration (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Removed old `claudify.bft.ts` command infrastructure
- ✅ Created new `agentify.bft.ts` command with enhanced functionality
- ✅ Generated commands now created in `.agents/commands/bft/`
- ✅ Updated git workflow to track generated files

### ✅ Phase 2: Integration (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Symlink architecture implemented (`.claude/commands/bft/` →
  `.agents/commands/bft/`)
- ✅ `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` both symlink to central configuration
- ✅ Generated files now checked into version control
- ✅ Integration with BFT land command for automated regeneration

### ✅ Phase 3: Advanced Features (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Enhanced AI deck support with TOML context injection
- ✅ Comprehensive command documentation generation
- ✅ 27+ AI agent commands covering full development lifecycle
- ✅ Safety validation integration with `aiSafe` property system

### ✅ Phase 4: Multi-Tool Support (COMPLETED)

- ✅ Tool-agnostic architecture supporting Claude Code and future tools
- ✅ Automated cleanup and regeneration workflows
- ✅ Generated files treated as build artifacts with proper lifecycle management

## Current Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)

The redesigned agent infrastructure is now fully operational with the following
architecture:

### Directory Structure

```
.agents/
  commands/
    bft/
      AGENTS.md        # Source of truth for agent instructions
      {command}.md     # Generated command files for each BFT task
.claude/
  commands/
    bft/              # Symlink to .agents/commands/bft/
AGENTS.md             # Symlink to .agents/commands/bft/AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md             # Symlink to .agents/commands/bft/AGENTS.md
```

### Implemented Features

1. **✅ Source of Truth**: `.agents/commands/bft/` is the canonical location for
   all agent commands
2. **✅ Symlink Architecture**: Claude Code and other tools access via symlinks
3. **✅ Generated Files**: All generated files are checked into version control
   as build artifacts
4. **✅ Single Command**: `agentify.bft.ts` replaces old `claudify` system
5. **✅ Enhanced Documentation**: Rich command descriptions with usage examples
   and context
6. **✅ Safety Integration**: Full integration with BFT safety validation system
7. **✅ Deck Support**: Comprehensive support for AI deck files with TOML
   context injection

### Command Generation Process

The `bft agentify` command now:

1. **Discovers all BFT tasks** from `infra/bft/tasks/` directory
2. **Processes `.bft.ts` files** and generates command wrappers
3. **Processes `.bft.deck.md` files** and creates full AI conversation templates
4. **Generates AGENTS.md** with comprehensive project guidance
5. **Creates symlinks** for tool compatibility (`CLAUDE.md`,
   `.claude/commands/bft/`)
6. **Validates safety** and marks commands appropriately for AI agents

### Integration Points

1. **BFT Land Integration**: `bft land` automatically runs `bft agentify` before
   commits
2. **Safety Validation**: All commands validated through `bft safety` system
3. **Context Management**: TOML files provide structured parameter injection
4. **Tool Compatibility**: Symlinks support Claude Code and future AI tools

## Achieved Benefits

1. **✅ Single Source of Truth**: All agent config consolidated in
   `.agents/commands/bft/`
2. **✅ Tool Agnostic**: Architecture supports Claude Code and extensible to
   other AI tools
3. **✅ Version Control**: Generated files tracked for debugging and consistency
4. **✅ Consistency**: Follows established patterns for generated code in BFT
   ecosystem
5. **✅ Enhanced Safety**: Comprehensive AI safety validation integrated
   throughout
6. **✅ Rich Documentation**: Commands now include context-aware usage examples
   and guidance
7. **✅ Automated Maintenance**: Self-updating system through BFT land
   integration

## Migration Completed

- ✅ **Breaking Change Handled**: Successfully replaced `claudify` workflow with
  `agentify`
- ✅ **Cleanup Completed**: All legacy `.claude/commands/` content regenerated
- ✅ **No Rollback Needed**: Migration successful, system stable

## Implemented Future Extensions

This architecture now supports multiple agent tools and has been extended with:

- ✅ **Claude Code Integration**: Full compatibility with Claude Code CLI
- ✅ **Sophisticated AI Decks**: Complex conversation patterns for specialized
  workflows
- ✅ **Context Parameter System**: TOML-based dynamic parameter injection
- ✅ **Safety Validation**: Multi-layered safety checking for AI operations
- ✅ **Command Documentation**: Auto-generated rich documentation for all
  commands

## Next Phase Opportunities

With this infrastructure foundation completed, future enhancements can focus on:

1. **Enhanced Context Management**: More sophisticated parameter discovery and
   validation
2. **Workflow Orchestration**: Multi-step AI workflows with error handling
3. **Advanced Safety Features**: Granular permission controls and dynamic
   validation
4. **Additional Tool Support**: Easy integration with Cursor AI, VSCode
   extensions, etc.
5. **Analytics and Monitoring**: Usage tracking and effectiveness measurement
   for AI agents
