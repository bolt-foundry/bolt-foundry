# Backlog Documentation in Project Structure

## What is a Backlog?

In the Bolt Foundry documentation structure, a "backlog" is a dedicated section
that captures potential features, enhancements, or improvements that have been
identified but are currently out of scope for immediate implementation. These
are items that might be incorporated in future versions.

## Purpose of Maintaining a Backlog

The backlog serves several important functions:

1. **Idea Preservation**: Captures valuable ideas that emerge during development
   but don't fit current priorities
2. **Future Planning**: Provides a pool of potential features for upcoming
   versions
3. **Scope Management**: Helps maintain focus on current priorities while still
   documenting future possibilities
4. **Institutional Knowledge**: Preserves context and reasoning around potential
   future work

## Where to Store Backlog Documentation

Backlog documentation should be integrated into the existing documentation
structure:

### Project-Level Backlog

For broad backlog items that aren't specific to a particular version:

```
apps/[project]/docs/backlog/
  ├── features.md         (Potential new features)
  ├── enhancements.md     (Improvements to existing features)
  └── technical-debt.md   (Code quality improvements)
```

### Version-Specific Deferred Items

For items that were considered for a specific version but deferred:

```
apps/[project]/docs/[version]/backlog.md
```

## How to Document Backlog Items

Backlog items should include:

- **Clear title and description**: What the item is
- **Justification**: Why it should be considered for future implementation
- **Priority indication**: Relative importance (High/Medium/Low)
- **Complexity assessment**: Estimated implementation difficulty
- **Target version**: When it might be implemented (if known)

## Relationship with Other Documentation

The backlog documentation complements other documents in the structure:

- **Project Plan**: Defines the overall vision and goals
- **Implementation Plan**: Details what WILL be built
- **Backlog**: Documents what MIGHT be built in the future
- **Version-specific Plans**: Focus on current implementation scope

## Backlog Management Process

Follow the
[Backlog Management Protocol](../cards/behaviors/backlog-management.bhc.md) for
guidelines on:

- Adding items to the backlog
- Reviewing and prioritizing backlog items
- Promoting items from backlog to implementation plans
- Deferring items from current plans to the backlog

## Example: Backlog Item Format

### Enhanced Analytics Dashboard

**Priority**: Medium **Type**: Feature Enhancement **Complexity**: Moderate
**Target Version**: 0.4

**Description**: Add advanced filtering and custom report generation to the
analytics dashboard.

**Justification**: Current users have requested more granular control over
analytics views, but this is not critical for the core functionality in the
current version.

**Dependencies**:

- Analytics data storage refactoring
- User permissions system updates

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Users can create and save custom dashboard configurations
- Reports can be exported in multiple formats
- Filtering supports complex Boolean operations
```

By maintaining a well-structured backlog, teams can balance the need to document
future possibilities while keeping current implementation plans focused and
achievable.
