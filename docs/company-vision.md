# Bolt Foundry company vision

## Mission

**Make LLM development as reliable and maintainable as traditional software
engineering.**

## The problem we're solving

Today's LLM development reflects earlier ages of programming. Developers write
prompts as massive text strings... the equivalent of writing SQL queries by hand
instead of using an ORM, or building HTML by concatenating strings instead of
using components.

This approach creates fundamental problems:

- **Unreliable systems**: Developers view changes as magic rather than a
  science... One small change to fix one thing breaks two other things.
- **Unmaintainable code**: No structure, no reusability, no clear interfaces
- **Untestable components**: Can't verify individual pieces work correctly
- **Scaling nightmares**: Each new use case requires starting from scratch

We believe LLM applications deserve the same engineering rigor as any other
software system.

## Why we're working on this

Our team has been building together for 7+ years, from our first company
Vidpresso (acquired by Facebook) through Content Foundry and now Bolt Foundry.
Through this journey, we've discovered a consistent pattern: it's easy to build
impressive LLM demos, but extremely hard to scale them into reliable, repeatable
systems.

Our team combines journalism, content creation, and
technical expertise. This gives us deep insight into driving attention
efficiently — the same principles that make great content (inverted pyramid,
active voice, clear structure) are exactly what LLMs need to perform reliably.

The timing is perfect. LLM model improvements have plateaued since GPT-4, but
inference-side optimization is wide open. Most companies accept "good enough"
reliability, but the ones who achieve 99% reliability will dominate their
markets. We're building the infrastructure to make that possible.

## Our vision

**Bolt Foundry will be the operating system for LLMs** — providing the
foundational infrastructure that every LLM application needs to be reliable,
maintainable, and scalable.

Just as Microsoft became the standard operating system by making computing
accessible to everyone, we're building the platform that makes LLM development
predictable and scalable for every developer. Like DOS and Windows created a
massive market by abstracting away hardware complexity, we're abstracting away
prompt engineering complexity to unlock the full potential of LLM applications.

## How we see the future

### Today: The SQL era

- Developers manually craft text prompts
- Each prompt is created arbitrarily without understanding crucial ideas like
  driving attention, organization, voice and tone, second person, inverted
  pyramid, active voice, etc.
- Changes require manual testing. Testing takes hours, longer than writing the
  prompt.
- Knowledge trapped in individual developer's heads
- No clear upgrade paths or versioning

### Tomorrow: The framework era

- Developers compose prompts using semantic APIs
- Reusable components with clear interfaces
- Unit testing for individual prompt components
- Automated testing and validation
- Shared libraries of proven patterns
- Seamless updates and A/B testing

### Long-term: The operating system era

- Intelligent prompt optimization
- Real-time performance insights
- Automated quality assurance
- Enterprise-grade reliability and security
- Developer ecosystem around structured prompts

## Why this matters

### For developers

- **Productivity**: Build faster with reusable components
- **Confidence**: Unit test and validate prompt behavior at the component level
- **Maintainability**: Update systems without breaking everything
- **Collaboration**: Share and improve prompt patterns across teams

### For companies

- **Reliability**: LLM applications that work consistently
- **Scalability**: Systems that grow with business needs
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimize prompt performance automatically
- **Risk Reduction**: Predictable behavior in production

### For the industry

- **Democratization**: Make advanced LLM techniques accessible
- **Standardization**: Establish best practices and conventions
- **Innovation**: Free developers to focus on unique value, not infrastructure
- **Trust**: Enable LLM adoption in mission-critical applications

## Our principles

### Engineering first

We believe great LLM applications are built, not discovered. They require the
same discipline, testing, and structure as any reliable software system.

### Developer experience

Our tools should feel natural to developers. We prioritize clarity,
composability, and familiar patterns over clever abstractions.

### Gradual adoption

Developers shouldn't have to rewrite everything. Our tools provide migration
paths from existing text prompts to structured systems.

### Open foundation

The core patterns and principles should be open and extensible. We build
platforms, not silos.

## What success looks like

We'll know we're succeeding when:

- **Developers prefer structured prompts** over text strings for new projects
- **LLM applications achieve web-scale reliability** (99.9%+ uptime)
- **Prompt engineering becomes teachable** through clear patterns, conventions,
  and unit testing practices
- **Enterprise adoption accelerates** due to predictable, maintainable systems
- **An ecosystem emerges** of shared components and best practices

## The world we're building

In five years, we envision a world where:

- Writing raw text prompts feels as archaic as programming in assembly language
- LLM applications have the same reliability expectations as web applications
- Companies deploy LLM systems confidently in production
- The next generation of AI applications is built on structured, semantic
  foundations

**Bolt Foundry exists to make this future inevitable.**
