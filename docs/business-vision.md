# Bolt Foundry business vision

## Revenue model

We will charge a monthly subscription fee for credits that expire each month.
This credit-based system enables usage-based pricing while providing predictable
revenue:

- **Event Storage**: Each stored event (prompts, responses, interactions)
  consumes credits
- **Inference Services**: Token-based fees for services like reconciling samples
  against persona/behavior cards
- **Advanced Analytics**: Batch evaluations, performance analysis, and
  optimization services
- **Potential LLM Intermediary**: Similar to OpenRouter, though value
  proposition still being evaluated

This model follows successful precedents like Replit, allowing us to charge
based on value delivered while giving flexibility in credit allocation for
different customer types.

## Go-to-market strategy

### Primary: developer-led growth + content marketing

Our core strategy leverages our team's journalism and content creation
background:

- **Educational Content**: Blog posts explaining journalism principles applied
  to LLM attention
- **Thought Leadership**: Podcasts, speaking engagements, and industry
  discussions about structured prompt engineering
- **Developer Community**: Building relationships with LLM application
  developers through valuable insights
- **Open Source Evangelism**: Using our open source tools as entry points for
  deeper engagement

The novelty of our approach—applying journalism principles to prompt
engineering—creates natural content opportunities and differentiates us in a
crowded market.

### Distribution channels

**Open Source + Freemium Model:**

- Core prompt restructuring CLI tool available open source
- Basic evaluation capabilities provided free
- Advanced features (batch evaluations, enterprise analytics) monetized
- Natural progression from individual developer tools to team/enterprise
  features

This aligns with our "Gradual Adoption" principle from our
[company vision](./company-vision.md), allowing developers to experience value
before committing to paid services.

## Customer acquisition funnel

1. **Awareness**: Content marketing and thought leadership establish our
   expertise
2. **Trial**: Developers use free CLI tool to restructure existing prompts
3. **Value Realization**: Basic evaluations demonstrate improved prompt
   reliability
4. **Conversion**: Teams need batch processing, advanced analytics, or
   collaboration features
5. **Expansion**: Enterprise customers require enhanced security, support, and
   custom integrations

## Market strategy

### Early stage: developer tools

Focus on individual developers and small teams experiencing prompt reliability
issues. Provide immediate value through prompt restructuring and basic
evaluation tools.

### Growth stage: team platforms

Expand to development teams needing collaboration, version control, and shared
prompt libraries. Add team management and advanced analytics features.

### Mature stage: enterprise infrastructure

Become the standard for mission-critical LLM applications requiring
enterprise-grade reliability, security, and compliance.

## Competitive positioning

Unlike existing solutions (Langchain, DSPy) that are "leaky abstractions"
requiring deep model knowledge, we provide true abstraction similar to Rails
hiding SQL complexity. Our journalism-informed approach to driving attention is
unique in the market.

We compete on:

- **Ease of use**: No deep LLM knowledge required
- **Reliability**: Journalism principles create more consistent outputs
- **Developer experience**: Familiar patterns and gradual adoption paths
- **True abstraction**: Hide complexity rather than expose it

## Financial philosophy

We prefer bootstrapping toward ramen profitability over raising large amounts of
capital. This approach:

- Maintains focus on customer value over growth metrics
- Preserves optionality for future funding or strategic decisions
- Aligns with our team's preference for sustainable, collaborative work
- Forces discipline around product-market fit before scaling

We're open to funding if it accelerates our mission to help people build better
LLM applications, but not dependent on it for survival.

## Success metrics

**Revenue Metrics:**

- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) growth
- Credit consumption patterns and trends
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) vs Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Product Metrics:**

- CLI tool adoption and usage frequency
- Conversion from free to paid features
- Prompt reliability improvements measured by customers

**Market Metrics:**

- Developer mindshare in LLM engineering communities
- Content engagement and thought leadership recognition
- Open source project adoption and contributions

## Long-term vision

We see multiple paths to success:

- **Large Company**: Becoming the "Microsoft for LLMs" - the standard operating
  system for LLM development
- **Major Open Source Project**: Driving industry standards while monetizing
  enterprise services
- **Strategic Acquisition**: Providing core infrastructure for larger platforms

Our priority is building something important that helps developers create more
reliable LLM applications, regardless of the specific business outcome.
