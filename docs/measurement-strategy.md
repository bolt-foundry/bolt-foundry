# Measurement Strategy

## Primary KPIs

**Leading Indicator**: Prompts generated  
The key behavior that drives all downstream value - when developers build more structured prompts, they're adopting our approach and creating the foundation for reliability improvements.

**Lagging Indicator**: Test runs completed  
Validates that our leading metric correlates with value delivery - when developers systematically test their prompts, they're realizing the reliability benefits we promise.

## Conversion Funnel

### Stage 1: Trial
**Key Behavior**: First experience with structured prompts
- People using our prompt converter
- npm installs of our library
- GitHub stars

### Stage 2: Activation  
**Key Behavior**: Successfully integrated into codebase and running
- Structured prompts deployed to codebase (primary metric)
- First production API call made
- API keys generated and used
- Initial prompts generated from converter
- Code commits containing Bolt Foundry imports

### Stage 3: Retention
**Key Behavior**: Returning to run tests
- Returned within 7 days of first test
- Test runs in 2+ separate weeks
- Monthly active test users
- Days between test sessions

### Stage 4: Value Realization
**Key Behavior**: Systematic validation and testing
- A/B tests run
- Evals completed
- Test runs (combined metric)

### Stage 5: Revenue
**Key Behavior**: Paying for ongoing value
- Active customers paying
- MRR / ARR

- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)

## Phase-Based Measurement Focus

### Alpha (v0.1-0.5): Trial Metrics
**Primary Focus**: Getting people to try structured prompts
- People using prompt converter
- Prompts generated from converted prompts
- Samples received through structured prompts

### Private Beta (v0.6-0.7): Retention Metrics  
**Primary Focus**: User retention and repeat usage
- 7-day retention rate (primary metric)
- Test runs per retained user
- Platform adoption via hash lookups

### Public Beta (v0.8-0.9): Full Funnel
**Primary Focus**: Complete conversion path and value realization
- Site visits and waitlist signups (top of funnel)
- Test runs completed (key lagging indicator)
- All retention metrics

### Future Work (v1.0+): Revenue Metrics
**Primary Focus**: Business sustainability and growth
- Active customers paying
- MRR growth
- Enterprise customer expansion

## Measurement Philosophy

### One Hop Upstream
Our primary KPI (prompts generated) sits "one hop upstream" from the end value we deliver. Rather than measuring reliability improvements directly (which are hard to quantify and slow to observe), we measure the key behavior that consistently drives those improvements.

### Leading/Lagging Balance
We track both leading indicators (prompts generated) that predict future success and lagging indicators (test runs) that validate our assumptions about value delivery.

### Funnel Coherence
Each stage in our funnel represents a meaningful behavioral commitment level, from casual trial to systematic adoption to revenue conversion. Metrics within each stage should predict advancement to the next stage.

### Phase Alignment
Our measurement focus evolves with product maturity - early phases focus on product-market fit signals, later phases focus on growth and revenue optimization.

## Success Criteria

**Short-term** (Alpha/Private Beta): Demonstrate that structured prompts create measurable engagement and testing behavior among early adopters.

**Medium-term** (Public Beta): Prove that our conversion funnel works at scale, with clear progression from trial through value realization.

**Long-term** (Future Work): Establish sustainable business metrics with predictable revenue growth driven by our core engagement behaviors.
