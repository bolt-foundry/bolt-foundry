  for v0.1
- The Collector (v0.0.1) provides foundational analytics that will expand with
  future product features
- GraphQL Builder (v0.0.3) has core functionality but is on hold pending v0.0.4
  improvements
- **Contacts app is deprecated** - Waitlist functionality needs to be migrated
  to bfDb with GraphQL integration
- For detailed 2025 roadmap including Alpha, Private Beta, and Public Beta
  phases, see [Product Plan](/docs/product-plan.md)
- Individual project status is tracked in their respective docs directories when
  available
