## Current Focus

Bolt Foundry is building the **Operating System for LLMs**. Our current priorities for v0.1 are:

1. **Examples & Documentation** - Fixing the NextJS sample application with proper TypeScript support and build process
2. **Developer Experience** - Creating clear, working examples that demonstrate Bolt Foundry capabilities
3. **Core SDK Stability** - Ensuring the bolt-foundry package (v0.1.0) provides a solid foundation

### Active Work (v0.1)
- Fixing TypeScript issues in NextJS example
- Adding proper build documentation
- Creating deployment examples
- Improving developer onboarding experience

## Notes

- The bolt-foundry library is actively being developed with focus on examples for v0.1
- The Collector (v0.0.1) provides foundational analytics that will expand with future product features
- GraphQL Builder (v0.0.3) has core functionality but is on hold pending v0.0.4 improvements
- **Contacts app is deprecated** - Waitlist functionality needs to be migrated to bfDb with GraphQL integration
- Project ownership assignments are pending team expansion
- For detailed 2025 roadmap including Alpha, Private Beta, and Public Beta phases, see [Product Plan](/docs/product-plan.md)
- Individual project status is tracked in their respective docs directories when available
