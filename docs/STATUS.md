## Current Focus

Bolt Foundry is transitioning to become the **Operating System for LLMs**. Our
current priorities are:

1. **Product Vision Alignment** - Updating our roadmap to reflect the OS for
   LLMs vision
2. **Core Infrastructure** - Continuing development of the bolt-foundry library
3. **Platform Foundation** - Preparing for the structured prompt tooling
   outlined in our product plan

## Notes

- Most projects are on hold or complete pending vision and roadmap updates
- The Collector (v0.0.1) provides foundational analytics that will expand with
  future product features
- GraphQL Builder (v0.0.3) has core functionality but needs completion for full
  production use
- Project ownership should be added to the table as it becomes formalized
- Status updates should be synchronized with implementation status documentation
- Projects are primarily tracked through their respective documentation in
  `apps/[project]/docs/` and `packages/[project]/docs/`
