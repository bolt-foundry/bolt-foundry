# Demo: TOML Front Matter in Blog Posts

This blog post demonstrates the new TOML front matter support we've added to our
blog system.

## Features

- **Author**: The post author can be specified in the front matter
- **Dates**: Both publishedAt and updatedAt timestamps with timezone support
- **Tags**: Array of tags for categorization
- **Excerpt**: Custom excerpt instead of auto-generated

## Benefits

Using TOML front matter provides:

1. Better metadata organization
2. Timezone-aware date handling
3. Structured data for GraphQL queries
4. Custom excerpts for better SEO

This makes our blog system more powerful and flexible!
