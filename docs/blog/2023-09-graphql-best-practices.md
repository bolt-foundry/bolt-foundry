# GraphQL Best Practices: Building Efficient APIs

_September 22, 2023_

GraphQL has revolutionized how we build and consume APIs. However, with great
power comes great responsibility. Here are essential best practices for building
efficient GraphQL APIs.

## Schema Design

- **Think in graphs, not endpoints**: Design your schema around relationships
- **Use clear, consistent naming**: Follow naming conventions (camelCase for
  fields)
- **Leverage the type system**: Make invalid states unrepresentable

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Implement DataLoader

```javascript
const userLoader = new DataLoader(async (userIds) => {
  const users = await db.users.findByIds(userIds);
  return userIds.map((id) => users.find((user) => user.id === id));
});
```

### 2. Add Query Complexity Analysis

Prevent expensive queries by analyzing complexity before execution.

### 3. Use Field-Level Permissions

Control access at the field level, not just the query level.

## Error Handling

Always return meaningful error messages with proper error codes. Use GraphQL's
built-in error handling rather than throwing exceptions.

Building great GraphQL APIs requires thoughtful design and careful
implementation of performance optimizations.
