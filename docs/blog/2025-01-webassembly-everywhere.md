# WebAssembly Everywhere: Beyond the Browser

_January 22, 2025_

WebAssembly (Wasm) has broken free from the browser and is revolutionizing how
we think about portable, secure, and fast code execution.

## Wasm Beyond Browsers

### Edge Computing

```rust
// Compile to Wasm and run at the edge
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Response {
    match req.path() {
        "/api/transform" => transform_image(req.body()),
        "/api/validate" => validate_data(req.body()),
        _ => Response::not_found()
    }
}
```

### Plugin Systems

Many applications now use Wasm for safe, sandboxed plugins:

- **Databases**: Extensions in PostgreSQL, Redis modules
- **Service meshes**: Envoy proxy filters
- **Development tools**: VS Code extensions

### Serverless Functions

```javascript
// JavaScript host running Wasm modules
const wasmModule = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBuffer);
const result = wasmModule.exports.processData(input);
```

## WASI: The System Interface

WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) enables Wasm to:

- Access files (with permissions)
- Network communication
- System time and random numbers

## Real-World Applications

1. **Figma**: Rendering engine in C++ compiled to Wasm
2. **Cloudflare Workers**: Run any language at the edge
3. **Docker Desktop**: Wasm as a container alternative
4. **AI/ML inference**: ONNX runtime in browsers

## Getting Started

```bash
# Compile Rust to Wasm
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi

# Run with Wasmtime
wasmtime run target/wasm32-wasi/debug/my_app.wasm

# Or with Node.js
node --experimental-wasi-unstable-preview1 run-wasm.js
```

WebAssembly is becoming the universal runtime for portable, secure computation.
