# Rust for Web Developers: Why You Should Care

_November 10, 2023_

Rust is making waves in the web development community, and for good reason. From
WebAssembly to blazing-fast web servers, Rust offers unique advantages for web
developers.

## Why Rust?

- **Memory safety without garbage collection**: Prevent entire classes of bugs
- **Fearless concurrency**: Write parallel code without data races
- **Zero-cost abstractions**: High-level code with low-level performance

## Web Development with Rust

### WebAssembly

Rust has first-class support for compiling to WebAssembly:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn greet(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

### Web Frameworks

Popular Rust web frameworks include:

- **Actix-web**: High-performance actor framework
- **Rocket**: Ergonomic and type-safe
- **Axum**: Built on tokio and tower

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust:
   `curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`
2. Try the Rust Book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
3. Build something small and iterate

Rust's learning curve is worth it for the performance and safety benefits it
brings to web development.
