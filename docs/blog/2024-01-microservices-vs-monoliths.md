# Microservices vs Monoliths: Making the Right Choice in 2024

_January 18, 2024_

The debate between microservices and monolithic architectures continues to
evolve. In 2024, the answer isn't as clear-cut as "microservices for
everything."

## The Monolith Renaissance

Many teams are returning to monoliths, but with a twist:

- **Modular monoliths**: Internal boundaries without network calls
- **Better tooling**: Modern deployment and monitoring for monoliths
- **Simplified operations**: One deployment, one database, one codebase

## When Microservices Make Sense

- **Team autonomy**: Large organizations with independent teams
- **Polyglot requirements**: Different services need different languages
- **Scaling patterns**: Services with vastly different scaling needs

## The Hybrid Approach

```yaml
# Start with a monolith
app/
  ├── modules/
  │   ├── users/
  │   ├── orders/
  │   └── payments/
  └── shared/

# Extract services when needed
services/
  ├── api-gateway/
  ├── core-app/  # The monolith
  └── payment-service/  # Extracted for compliance
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Start with a well-structured monolith
2. Extract services based on real needs, not hypothetical ones
3. Invest in observability regardless of architecture

The best architecture is the one that matches your team's needs and
capabilities.
