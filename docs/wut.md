## Cards

Cards are the foundation of Bolt Foundry. They can be represented as markdown
text or in code. Each card contains:

1. A title
2. A summary
3. Specs (or spec groups) - groups of related specs or other spec groups (can
   have samples attached)
4. Spec (or spec items) - individual rules or guidelines within specs (can have
   samples attached)

Both specs and individual spec items can have samples attached to demonstrate
the principle in action. While spec groups can be nested, we recommend limiting
nesting depth and instead composing multiple cards together. Cards are designed
for both humans and machines to understand, reference, and use to reinforce
specific principles and behaviors.

Cards typically define:

- **Persona cards** - Core essence and characteristics of an LLM system
- **Behavior cards** - Actionable protocols and best practices

This approach lets us build reliable LLM systems through composable, verifiable
components that both humans and machines can understand.

Anthropic's
[constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claudes-constitution) concept
was an inspiration for our card system. While constitutions define AI behavior
through principles, we expanded this into a more flexible card system.

## Priority system

| Priority  | Meaning                             | Description                                                            |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Püî• (UBN) | UNBREAK NOW!!                       | Urgent AND important - actively causing damage and needs immediate fix |
| P0        | THE thing we're heading toward      | Important and urgent, only one project at a time                       |
| P1.x      | Someone is actively working on this | Urgent, maybe important, but less important than P0                    |
| P2.x      | We should do this soon              | Important but not urgent yet - we expect it to become urgent soon      |

## Project phases

See [version numbers](#version-numbers) for how versions typically align with
project phases.

| Phase        | Characteristics                                                                                                         | Customer commitment                                                                                                                            |

## Project status

Wut do these status emojis mean?

- **In Progress üöÄ** = Actively working on it right now
- **Stable üü¢** = It works, we're not changing it much
- **On Hold ‚è±Ô∏è** = Paused, might come back to it
- **Complete ‚úÖ** = Done. Just maintaining it now
- **Deprecated üö´** = Please stop using this, we have something better

## Sample vs example

At Bolt Foundry, we use the term **samples** instead of "examples" when
referring to instances of LLM behavior or output. Samples represent concrete
instances of an LLM's capabilities that can be tested, verified, and reused.

## SEVs (site events)

SEVs are production incidents that require immediate response. Only launched
(production) systems can trigger SEVs.

### SEV levels

- **SEV-0**: Complete outage or data loss risk. Critical metrics (revenue) could
  be affected. The company's long-term trajectory could be altered if not dealt
  with
- **SEV-1**: Major functionality broken for many users. Significant business
  impact if not resolved quickly
- **SEV-2**: Significant issue affecting some users. Customer satisfaction at
  risk
- **SEV-3**: Minor issue with workaround available. Still needs timely
  resolution
- **SEV-4**: Planned maintenance or something happening that could cause an
  issue

### Pre-production incidents

For alpha, private beta, and public beta stages:

- Issues create UBN tasks instead of SEVs
- Direct engineering support without formal incident process
- No SLA commitments

### SEV reviews

- **SEV-0 through SEV-3**: Require postmortem after resolution
- **SEV-4**: Requires premortem before planned maintenance
- Reviews focus on learning, not blame
- Document what happened, why, and how to prevent recurrence
- SEV levels can increase but should never decrease
- Each SEV level indicates more systems and people should be working on the
  problem

## Version numbers

We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) with the pattern
v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH], where version numbers can be double digits (v0.15.2,
v1.23.0, etc.).

### How versions align with phases

[Project phases](#project-phases) don't cleanly map to specific version ranges -
a project might stay in alpha through v0.15 or reach production at v0.8. These
are rough guidelines:

- **v0.0.x** = Pre-alpha
- **Early v0.x** = Alpha
- **Mid v0.x** = Private Beta
- **Late v0.x** = Public Beta
- **v1.0+** = Production

Beta and earlier phases typically increment minor version numbers (v0.1 ‚Üí v0.2),
while production releases increment the major version (v1.0 ‚Üí v2.0) for each
significant release.

### Semantic versioning

Format: **Major.Minor.Patch**

- Major = Breaking changes
- Minor = New features
- Patch = Bug fixes
