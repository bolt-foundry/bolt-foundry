# Bolt Foundry Terminology Guide

## Sample vs Example

At Bolt Foundry, we use the term **samples** instead of "examples" when
referring to instances of LLM behavior or output. Samples represent concrete
instances of an LLM's capabilities that can be tested, verified, and reused.

## Cards

Cards are simply a document that:

1. A title
2. A summary
3. A hierarchical set of rules that are typically only 1-2 levels great

The intention is for both humans and machines to understand them, and reference
them directly and point samples to them to reinforce and disambiguate specific
principles.

## Identity Card vs Constitution

We use **Identity Card** to define the core essence and characteristics of an
LLM system. Identity Cards represent a verified, tested unit of LLM
functionality that can be composed into larger systems.

Similarly, we use **Behavior Card** to define actionable protocols and best
practices for implementing LLM systems, rather than referring to these as
"constitutions".

These terminology choices reflect our structured approach to building reliable
LLM systems through testable, verifiable components.
